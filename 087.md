The function `getFrozenInfo` travers the vouchees array and calculates `uint256 memberTotalFrozen, uint256 memberFrozenCoinAge.`
When the vouchees array is large, calling this function could revert due to out of gas.

Loading of two type of struct data in memory and math operations are done, this could be gas costly and could revert when vouchee size is large.

Put cap on number of vouchee size.
Do operation based on upto certain index and then do for others. 
Do not use for full length of array in single shot.
