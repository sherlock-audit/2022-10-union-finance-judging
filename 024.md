# Interest can potentially be wrongly calculated, when a borrower repays.

## Summary
Interest can potentially be wrongly calculated, when a borrower repays.

## Vulnerability Detail
Example:

When a borrower wants to repay a loan, he calls the function `repayBorrow()`, which calls the internal function `_repayBorrowFresh()`. This is where the problem occurs:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/market/UToken.sol#L573-L646

First it will call the function `accrueInterest`, which will update the `accrualBlockNumber` with the `currentBlockNumber` and `borrowIndex` with `borrowIndexNew`

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/market/UToken.sol#L652-L661

The problem here is, when the function calls `calculatingInterest()` to calculate the interest.
Since `accrualBlockNumber` and `borrowIndex` were already updated with the `currentBlockNumber` and `borrowIndexNew` in the function `accrueInterest()`.

The outcome here will be:

// accrualBlockNumber will equal to currentBlockNumber, which was already updated in `accrueInterest()`, so the outcome is 0.
`uint256 blockDelta = currentBlockNumber - accrualBlockNumber` => `uint256 blockDelta = 0`

// Since blockDelta is zero, the outcome of simpleInterestFactor will be also zero
`uint256 simpleInterestFactor = borrowRate * blockDelta` => `borrowRate * 0` => `uint256 simpleInterestFactor = 0`

// Since simpleInterestFactor is zero, `(simpleInterestFactor * borrowIndex) / WAD` => `(0 * borrowIndex) / 1e18` => `0`
// All left in the calculation will be `borrowIndex`, so `borrowIndexNew` will be equal to borrowIndex.
`uint256 borrowIndexNew = (simpleInterestFactor * borrowIndex) / WAD + borrowIndex` => `borrowIndexNew = borrowIndex`


https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/market/UToken.sol#L464-L480

The outcome of this will be that, when borrowers call the function `repayBorrow()` their interest can be wrongly calculated.
The interest will be calculated based on the old `borrowRatePerBlock` in `accrueInterest()` and not with the new `borrowRatePerBlock` in the function `calculatingInterest`.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/market/UToken.sol#L578-L580

If `borrowRatePerBlock` changes after the function `repayBorrowFresh()` is done with `if (!accrueInterest())` and goes to 
`uint256 interest`, the function will still calculate the interest based on the old `borrowRatePerBlock` used in `accrueInterest()`.

Duo to how it is now, the code in `calculatingInterest()` L471-L475 is irrelevant.

## Impact
Duo to the problem described in `Vulnerability Detail`, a scenario can happen when the interest will be calculated wrongly based on the old `borrowRatePerBlock`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider creating a function which will do both of the jobs for `accrueInterest()` and `calculatingInterest()`.
Example: https://gist.github.com/CodingNameKiki/14374f7b39ab87c0337905eb6db74835

// This function can be accessed only when a person repays, and won't lead to the problem occuring in "Vulnerability Detail".
