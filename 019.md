# Centralization Of Power

## Summary

This project uses the UUPS proxy pattern to enable contract modifications after the deployment. This enables an administrator to change the logic of the contracts while maintaining the state of the contracts, such as deposited assets.

## Vulnerability Detail

A compromised or malicious admin may change the logic of smart contracts after deployment.

## Impact

[`AssetManager.withdraw`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/asset/AssetManager.sol#L328)

The logic may be changed to allow a malicious actor to remove previously deposited user assets. This would result in a loss to users.

## Code Snippet

The Asset Manager inherits from Controller:

```solidity
contract AssetManager is Controller,
```

The Controller inherits from UUPS Upgradable:

```solidity
abstract contract Controller is Initializable, UUPSUpgradeable {
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Two approaches to this:

1) Implement a period of time where users are able to evaluate and decide whether they wish to participate in the upgraded system. Here's an example of this: https://docs.enzyme.finance/managers/signal-an-upgrade

2) Provide users with documentation where it is clear that there is an administrator of the system who may change the logic of the deployed contracts.
