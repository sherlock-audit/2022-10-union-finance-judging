# UserManager.sol#L397 : The function getCreditLimit could revert  due to out of gas and cause DOS

## Summary
The function `getCreditLimit`  travers the `vouchers` array and calculates the total credit limit.
When the `vouchers` array is large, calling this function could revert due to out of gas.

## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/user/UserManager.sol#L397-L403

when traversing the vouchers array, 

            Vouch memory vouch = vouchers[borrower][i];
            Staker memory staker = stakers[vouch.staker];
            total += _min(staker.stakedAmount - staker.locked, vouch.trust - vouch.locked);
        }

both voucher and stakes struct are loaded into memory and total value is calculated.
for total value calculation, `_min` function is used and this takes two arguments by consuming the gas for arithmetic operation.
Again, inside `_min` function, further calculation work is done.
likewise, for each voucher member, the work involved is more and gas consuming also more.

## Impact
Function can not be executed and can not get the credit limit when the voucher's array size is huge.
Front end can not fetch the `CreditLimit` that might be needed for deciding other criterias for end user.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Following are suggested to handle this.
1. Put cap on the number of vouchers.
2. Instead of having relying on voucher's array, have separate global variable that could keep track for credit limit.
