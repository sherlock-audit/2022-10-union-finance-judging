# Two initializer are used in the contract, the parent controller contract does not use "onlyInitializing" modifier

## Summary

Nested initializer used in the contract, but the parent contract does not use "onlyInitializing" modifier

## Vulnerability Detail

I want to quote direclty from openzeppelin doc

https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/1.x/writing-upgradeable#initializers

> Note that the initializer modifier can only be called once even when using inheritance, so parent contracts should use the onlyInitializing modifier:

The example that openzepplin give is that

```solidity
// contracts/MyContract.sol
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.6.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol";

contract BaseContract is Initializable {
    uint256 public y;

    function initialize() public onlyInitializing {
        y = 42;
    }
}

contract MyContract is BaseContract {
    uint256 public x;

    function initialize(uint256 _x) public initializer {
        BaseContract.initialize(); // Do not forget this call!
        x = _x;
    }
}
```

Oh well, this example applies to contract that inherits from the Controller contract.

The controller contract use the initializer modifying

```solidity
function __Controller_init(address admin_) public initializer 
```

However, All contract inherits from the controller also use the modify initializer 

In UserManager.sol

```solidity
contract UserManager is Controller, IUserManager, ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable
```

and

```solidity
  function __UserManager_init(
      address assetManager_,
      address unionToken_,
      address stakingToken_,
      address comptroller_,
      address admin_,
      uint256 maxOverdueBlocks_,
      uint256 effectiveCount_,
      uint256 maxVouchers_
  ) public initializer {
```

The same issue also exists in MarketRegistry.sol and UToken, UDai (which inherit from UToken), and AssetManager.sol and TokenAdapters and Comptroller.

## Impact

is  __Controller_init is called outside of the regular __init, the malicious user can become the admin. and the regular __init cannot be called.

## Recommendation

We recommend change

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/Controller.sol#L95-L100

to

```solidity
function __Controller_init(address admin_) public onlyInitializing {
  _paused = false;
  admin = admin_;
  __UUPSUpgradeable_init();
  pauseGuardian = admin_;
}
```
