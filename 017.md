# Fixed Decimal Loan Origination Fee Calculation

## Summary

The origination fee charged for loans is calculated with the assumption that the asset being borrowed has 18 decimals.

## Vulnerability Detail

[`UToken.calculatingFee`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/market/UToken.sol#L390)

The origination fee calculation uses a `WAD` which is a decimal number of 18 digits of precision. This is suitable for assets being borrowed that have 18 decimals, such as DAI. The calculation is incorrect for assets that do not use 18 decimals.

## Impact

Should an asset be added to the system that does not use 18 decimals, such as Tether, the loan origination fee will be incorrect.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function calculatingFee(uint256 amount) public view override returns (uint256) {
    return (originationFee * amount) / WAD;
}
````

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider whether the addition of borrow assets with non-standard number of decimals is desirable in the future. If so, refactor this loan origination fee calculation function to accommodate assets that do not use 18 decimals.
