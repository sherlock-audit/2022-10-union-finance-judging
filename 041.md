# `UserManager.updateFrozenInfo` cannot be called from `UToken`

## Summary
The new version of the contract doesn't allow `UserManager.updateFrozenInfo` to be called from `UToken`. Hence, if a borrower is overdue he will not be able to call `UToken._repayBorrowFresh` to repay his principal.

## Vulnerability Detail
When `UToken._repayBorrowFresh` is called with an overdue borrower as `borrower`, the call to `UToken._repayBorrowFresh` will always revert if `repayAmount >= interest` because `updateFrozenInfo` is called on the `UserManager` contract:
```solidity
            if (isOverdue) {
                // For borrowers that are paying back overdue balances we need to update their
                // frozen balance and the global total frozen balance on the UserManager
                IUserManager(userManager).updateFrozenInfo(borrower, 0);
```
But `UserManager.updateFrozenInfo` cannot be called from the `UToken` contract. Only the `Comptroller` contract can call this function:
```solidity
    function updateFrozenInfo(address staker, uint256 pastBlocks) external onlyComptroller returns (uint256, uint256) {
        return _updateFrozen(staker, pastBlocks);
    }
```

## Impact
When a borrower is overdue he will not be able to repay is principal. Any call to `UToken._repayBorrowFresh` with `repayAmount >= interest` will revert.

```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add access for the `UToken` contract to `UserManager.updateFrozenInfo` by using this modifier:
```solidity
modifier onlyMarketOrComptroller() {
        if (address(uToken) != msg.sender && address(comptroller) != msg.sender) revert AuthFailed();
        _;
    }
```
