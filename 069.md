# gas limit DoS via unbounded operations

## Summary
Only one attack will lead to two types of vulnerabilities in `UserManager.sol` and `UToken.sol`

## Vulnerability Detail
On `UserManager.sol` ==> `updateTrust()`
Case one:
 malicious users (members) can keep `vouching` Alice with `trustAmount == 0` until his `vouchers` array achieves the max limit (2**256-1)
So when a normal member tries to give `vouching` to Alice with `trustAmount != 0` he will find because the `vouchers` array completely full. 

Case two (which is more realistic ):
 malicious users (members) can keep `vouching` Alice with `trustAmount == 0` until his `vouchers` array achieves late’s say 20% of max limit (2**256-1)
The problem is when Alice invoke `borrow()` or `repayBorrow()` on `UToken.sol`

```solidity
   IUserManager(userManager).updateLocked(msg.sender, uint96(amount + fee), true);
  …
  IUserManager(userManager).updateLocked(borrower, uint96(repayAmount - interest), false);
```
It will call `updateLocked()` on `UserManager.sol`

```solidity
   function updateLocked(
        address borrower,
        uint96 amount,
        bool lock
    ) external onlyMarket {
        uint96 remaining = amount;

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < vouchers[borrower].length; i++) {
 
```
The for loop could go through `vouchers[]` which could be long enough to lead to a "gas limit DoS via unbounded operations" 
And the same thing with `registerMember()`, any user could lose all their fund in this transaction 
```solidity
       function registerMember(address newMember) public virtual whenNotPaused {
        if (stakers[newMember].isMember) revert NoExistingMember();

        uint256 count = 0;
        uint256 vouchersLength = vouchers[newMember].length;

        // Loop through all the vouchers to count how many active vouches there
        // are that are greater than 0. Vouch is the min of stake and trust
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < vouchersLength; i++) {

```



## Impact
1- The user couldn’t  get any more `vouching`
2- The user will be not able to `borrow()` or `repayBorrow()`
3- No one can in invoke`registerMember()` successfully for a specific user 

## Code Snippet
```solidity
   vouchers[borrower].push(Vouch(staker, trustAmount, 0, 0));

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < vouchersLength; i++) {

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add check for `trustAmount == 0`
