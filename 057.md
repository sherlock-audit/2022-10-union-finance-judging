# Partial reward retrieval isn't supported by Comptroller, freezing all rewards that exceed current balance

## Summary

Comptroller treats reward retrieval requests in the all or nothing manner, which leads to blocking large reward requests altogether: if there are not enough reward funds, the request isn't met at all, and next time rewards due are even bigger and the request can be not met this way again, and so on.

## Vulnerability Detail

I.e. as partial fulfilments aren't supported, all the biggest requests will be denied instead of partial fill when there is a shortage of reward funds. The shortage itself isn't an issue here, the fact that `0%` of the rewards due will be transferred to a staker in a situation when `99%` can be transferred is.

Also, such an insolvency isn't pro rata, instead it is the biggest stakers who support the system the most experience the full freeze.

The rewards due is accounted for by the `users[][].accrued` variable, but if there is not enough balance to transfer all of them, the whole amount will be frozen, by going to this accrual instead of actual reward token transfer, as any partial retrieval isn't supported and it's also not possible to transfer or divide the claim.

## Impact

Staker who have claims that can't be covered fully at the moment will have their full reward funds due being frozen.

As this is conditional on reward funds shortage setting the severity to be **medium**.

## Code Snippet

Comptroller's withdrawRewards(), which is called by user-facing stake(), unstake() and withdrawRewards() of UserManager, will not issue **any** rewards if there is not enough balance to transfer the whole amount due:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/token/Comptroller.sol#L250-L276

```solidity
        uint256 amount = _calculateRewardsByBlocks(
            account,
            token,
            pastBlocks,
            userInfo,
            userManagerState,
            userManagerAccountState
        );

        // update the global states
        uint256 totalStaked_ = userManagerState.totalStaked - userManagerState.totalFrozen;
        gInflationIndex = _getInflationIndexNew(totalStaked_, block.number - gLastUpdatedBlock);
        gLastUpdatedBlock = block.number;
        users[account][token].updatedBlock = block.number;
        users[account][token].inflationIndex = gInflationIndex;
        if (unionToken.balanceOf(address(this)) >= amount && amount > 0) {
            unionToken.safeTransfer(account, amount);
            users[account][token].accrued = 0;
            emit LogWithdrawRewards(account, amount);

            return amount;
        } else {
            users[account][token].accrued = amount;
            emit LogWithdrawRewards(account, 0);

            return 0;
        }
```

This way any rewards due to the `account` are effectively frozen. Moreover, on the next call rewards will be recalculated and increased, so there can be a situation that reward token balance was replenished, but rewards for the particular `account` grew enough to exceed this replenished total balance as well, keeping the rewards of this user frozen.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider introducing the partial instead of zero withdrawal when there is not enough funds to meet the whole claim, for example:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/token/Comptroller.sol#L250-L276

```solidity
        uint256 amount = _calculateRewardsByBlocks(
            account,
            token,
            pastBlocks,
            userInfo,
            userManagerState,
            userManagerAccountState
        );

        // update the global states
        uint256 totalStaked_ = userManagerState.totalStaked - userManagerState.totalFrozen;
        gInflationIndex = _getInflationIndexNew(totalStaked_, block.number - gLastUpdatedBlock);
        gLastUpdatedBlock = block.number;
        users[account][token].updatedBlock = block.number;
        users[account][token].inflationIndex = gInflationIndex;
+       if (amount > 0) {
+	    uint256 unionBalance = unionToken.balanceOf(address(this));
+	    uint256 toWithdraw = unionBalance > amount ? amount : (unionBalance > WITHDRAWAL_BUFFER : unionBalance - WITHDRAWAL_BUFFER : 0);
+           unionToken.safeTransfer(account, toWithdraw);
+           users[account][token].accrued = amount - toWithdraw;
+           emit LogWithdrawRewards(account, toWithdraw);
+           return toWithdraw;
+       }
-       if (unionToken.balanceOf(address(this)) >= amount && amount > 0) {
-           unionToken.safeTransfer(account, amount);
-           users[account][token].accrued = 0;
-           emit LogWithdrawRewards(account, amount);
-
-           return amount;
-       } else {
-           users[account][token].accrued = amount;
-           emit LogWithdrawRewards(account, 0);
-
-           return 0;
-       }
```

The `WITHDRAWAL_BUFFER` is introduced to prevent single account balance exhaustion. It can be also represented as a percentage of a claim, but this will open up a way for the repetitive requests. Plain buffer, on the other hand, can be managed according to the situation to introduce some protection and flexibility.
