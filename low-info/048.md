# No cap on Member fee

## Summary
On registration a member fee is deducted. But it seems there is no cap for same and this could be set to very high value

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Observe that setNewMemberFee has no cap check

```python
function setNewMemberFee(uint256 amount) external onlyAdmin {
        uint256 oldMemberFee = newMemberFee;
        newMemberFee = amount;
        emit LogSetNewMemberFee(oldMemberFee, amount);
    }
```

## Impact
User can lose too much of their funds as member fees
