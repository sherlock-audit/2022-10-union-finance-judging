# `removeAdapter()` does not ensure that the money market that is removed no longer carries any assets.

## Summary

The admin can remove supported money market, but this function is severely lacking in checks. For one, we should ensure that before removing support for a particular money market, withdraw all assets from underlying protocol first.

## Vulnerability Detail

Even though the removed adapter can always be added back, it may be "lost" if the assets stored are somehow forgotten. Removing support for a money market would remove all the balances associated with it. For example, calling `tokenSupplyView()` would return 0.

## Impact

Assets can become "lost" accidentally if admin is not aware of the assets stored in previously supported money market.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Revert the call if `tokenSupplyView()` of money market address is not 0. We can also do a full withdraw when the function is called.
