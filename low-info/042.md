# No `address(0)` check for `to` input address of `UToken.borrow`

## Summary
`UToken.borrow` can be called with `address(0)` as `to` which lead to loss of funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
Calling `UToken.borrow`, a member can choose to give to `to` the `amount` borrowed while taking accountability for it. But no `address(0)` check is made on the input address `to`.

## Impact
A member could unintendedly put the `address(0)` as `to` which lead to asset manager funds to be sent to `address(0), thus being unrecoverable.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/market/UToken.sol#L512
```solidity
    function borrow(address to, uint256 amount) external override onlyMember(msg.sender) whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
```

```solidity
        if (!assetManagerContract.withdraw(underlying, to, amount)) revert WithdrawFailed();
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a check to prevent `to ` from being `address(0)`.
