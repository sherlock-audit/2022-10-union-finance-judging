# Lack of sanity check for the percentage array in the function AssetManager.sol#rebalance

## Summary

Failed to verify that the sum of the percentages equals to 10000 bps when rebalancing.
There could be percentages of liquidity not getting rebalancef.

## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/asset/AssetManager.sol#L489-L497

The percentage array specifies the percentage of token rebalancing. However, while the percentage basis point is expressed in 10000, the code does not verify that the total percentage adds up to 10000, 

## Impact

Liquidity in the money market may be rebalanced unexpectedly if the total weight is smaller than 10000. If one of the percentages is set to more than 10000, the transaction can revert because maybe the underlying money market is not capable of handling such large liquidity.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the project check the total weight of the percentage adds up to 10000 before rebalancing.

```solidity
uint256 length = percentages.length;
uint256 weightSum;
for(uint256 i; i < length; ++i) {
   weightSum += percentages[i];
}
if(weightSum != 10000) revert InvalidPercetageBpsSum();
```
