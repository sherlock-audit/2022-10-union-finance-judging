# UserManager:debtWriteOff reverts if caller is not a member

## Summary
`UserManager:debtWriteOff` reverts if caller is not a member

## Vulnerability Detail
in `debtWriteOff` `cancelVouch` is called, which has the `onlyMember` modifier, so debt can only be written off by members and not by anybody when delay overdue is expired.

## Impact
Debt can only be written off by members and not by anybody when delay overdue is expired

            cancelVouch(staker, borrower);
        }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider defining an internal function `_cancelVouch` without access control with the internal code and call it through `cancelVouch` ( with access control) and in `debtWriteOff`
