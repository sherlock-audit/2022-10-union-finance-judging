# Any user can initialize Controller Contract and become admin

## Summary
The `__Controller_init()` function in Controller contract has no access control, this allows any user who calls the function first to become admin and take over the contract and subsequent contracts

## Vulnerability Detail
In Controller.__Controller_init() , the function is expected to be called manually after contract deployment. However, the function is not restricted and allows anyone to call the function. With this, the first user to call the function successfully becomes the admin of the Controller contract. This also presents front-running opportunities for a user monitoring the network to frontrun and be the admin of the contract. 

## Impact
Contract takeover. Any user can become admin and perform admin privileged activities.

```solidity
function __Controller_init(address admin_) public initializer {

        __UUPSUpgradeable_init();
        pauseGuardian = admin_;
    }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement necessary access control measures to the the function.
