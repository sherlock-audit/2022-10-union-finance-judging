# `originationFee` need sanity check

## Summary

Currently there is no bound check for `originationFee`. 


## Vulnerability Detail


No restrictions on the value of the `originationFee`, even it could be set above 100%. Although there is `maxBorrow` per user, the fee could be set up to this limit, borrowers can still lose certain large amount of fund compared to what is borrowed. No matter by mistake or intentionally, improper value of fee will make users lose fund. 


## Impact

Could have the following impacts:
- borrowers lose fund due to abnormal value of fee.
- compromised admin could even front run the fee setter functions to charge fee up to the limit, stealing fund from users.
