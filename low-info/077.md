# Unbounded loop in registerMemeber.sol when register new member can consume all the gas and revert transaction.

## Summary

Unbounded loop in registerMemeber.sol when registering a new member can revert the transaction when a new member is registered.

## Vulnerability Detail

When registering a new number, the function register member is called.

```solidity
function registerMember(address newMember) public virtual whenNotPaused {
```

however, the code loops through all the vouchers that give vouch to the new member. We keep the loop running until we check all the vouchers or stop the loop until we meet the effective count requirement.

```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < vouchersLength; i++) {
    Vouch memory vouch = vouchers[newMember][i];
    Staker memory staker = stakers[vouch.staker];
    if (staker.stakedAmount > 0) count++;
    if (count >= effectiveCount) break;
}
```

The number of vouch a new member received could be 10, could 100, could be 1000000, the loop may consume all the gas and revert the transaction when checking if a voucher has staked balance.

## Impact

The unbounded loop can consume all the gas and revert the transaction.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the project set a limit for the member to make sure a vouch cannot receive unlimited amount of vouch.

```solidity
  /**
   *  @dev Staker (staker) mapped to vouches given (borrower)
   */
  mapping(address => Vouchee[]) public vouchees;
```

if the current rate limiting, a voucher can vouch up to maxVouchers, otherwise transaction revert

```solidity
uint256 voucheesLength = vouchees[staker].length;
if (voucheesLength >= maxVouchers) revert MaxVouchees();
```

but that 1000000 members can still vouch for one address.
