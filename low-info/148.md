# UToken.sol#L518 : It is safe to consider to check for if(fee > 0)

## Summary
UToken.sol#L518 : During borrow of Utoken, fee is computed to proceed the borrow. But it is not validated whether the calculated fee value is greater than zero or not.

## Vulnerability Detail
There are chances that the calculated fee amount could be equal to zero. This can be seen by checking how the fee is calculated.

when the product of (originationFee * amount) is lesser than WAD, then the calculated fee will be zero.

## Impact
For some amount, user can borrow without paying fee. this could be loss to the protocol.
