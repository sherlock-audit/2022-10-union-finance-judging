# Wrong function called by `AaveV3Adapter` to deposit liquidity into Aave V3 pool

## Summary
`AaveV3Adapter` contains calls to Aave V3 lending pool. The function called at deposit is `deposit`. In V3, the name of the function changed and is called `supply`. The deployed contracts would revert and would be unusable because the call to Aave pool would be wrong.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `AaveV3Adapter:deposit`:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/asset/AaveV3Adapter.sol#L199-L203

```solidity
    function deposit(address tokenAddress) external override checkTokenSupported(tokenAddress) {
        IERC20Upgradeable token = IERC20Upgradeable(tokenAddress);
        uint256 amount = token.balanceOf(address(this));
        lendingPool.deposit(tokenAddress, amount, address(this), 0);
    }
```
From th Aave V3 docs, one can see that the `supply` function should be used instead: See https://docs.aave.com/developers/core-contracts/pool#supply

## Impact
The deployed contracts would revert and would be unusable because the call to Aave pool would be wrong

## Code Snippet

```solidity
    function deposit(address tokenAddress) external override checkTokenSupported(tokenAddress) {
        IERC20Upgradeable token = IERC20Upgradeable(tokenAddress);
        uint256 amount = token.balanceOf(address(this));
        lendingPool.deposit(tokenAddress, amount, address(this), 0);
    }
```

```diff
    function deposit(address tokenAddress) external override checkTokenSupported(tokenAddress) {
        IERC20Upgradeable token = IERC20Upgradeable(tokenAddress);
        uint256 amount = token.balanceOf(address(this));
-       lendingPool.deposit(tokenAddress, amount, address(this), 0);
+       lendingPool.supply(tokenAddress, amount, address(this), 0);
    }
