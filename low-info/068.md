# Wrong operator is used while comparing the floor map with the supply value of the money market

## Summary
Wrong operator is used while comparing the floor map with the supply value of the money market.

## Vulnerability Detail
The floor map value (See IMoneyMarketAdapter.sol#L64-L67) is the minimum amount that should be deposited in the money market. If the supply value is equal to the floor map value, the token SHOULD be allowed to be deposited to the money market.

if the supply value equals the ceiling value, it is still allowed to be deposited (See AssetManager.sol#L304), which is correct and THIS should be applied to minimum value too.

## Impact
If the supply value is equal to the floor map value, no token is allowed to be deposited into the money market, which is WRONG.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
`if (moneyMarket.floorMap(token) <= moneyMarket.getSupply(token)) continue;`

should be changed to

`if (moneyMarket.floorMap(token) < moneyMarket.getSupply(token)) continue;`
