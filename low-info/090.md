# MarketRegistry.sol#L79-L93 : Sanity check is missing when setUToken and setUserManager

## Summary
MarketRegistry.sol#L79-L93 : Sanity check is missing when calling setUToken and setUserManager

## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/market/MarketRegistry.sol#L79-L93

The functions, `setUToken` and `setUserManager` are callued to update the `uTokens[token] = uToken;` and `userManagers[token] = userManager;`
It is not checking whether they already assigned the token and user manager addresses. if they have such address, they would be overwritten and lost.

## Impact
By mistake if admin calls to update the token and user manager address that has updated already, this could override the existing the utoken and user manager address which is already is use.
Once the information is overwritten, it is lost only. All the functionalities that depend on these two, would be lost only.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I assume the protocol will not overwrite the uTokens[token] and userManagers[token].
If so, add check whether the userManagers[token] and uTokens[token]  already has address.
If not, use separate flag to forcefully update the uToken and userManager address.
