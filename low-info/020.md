# Non-Members Can Repay Loans

## Summary

Loans that have been originated can be repaid by the borrower. There is a missing conditional check that the repayer is the borrower. This means that non-members may interact with the system by repaying loans without holding Union tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

`UToken.repayBorrow`

[repayBorrow](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/market/UToken.sol#L561) is the external function for borrowers to repay their loans. This function calls an internal function named [`_repayBorrowFresh`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/market/UToken.sol#L573) which has a docstring that states that the function should only be callable from a member. There is no modifier on the external function and no logic within `_repayBorrowFresh` that validates that the caller is the borrower.

## Impact

Third parties may interact with the lending lifecycle without being a member.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function repayBorrow(address borrower, uint256 repayAmount) external override whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add the modifier to check the repayer is a member:

```solidity
function repayBorrow(address borrower, uint256 repayAmount) external override onlyMember(msg.sender) whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
```
