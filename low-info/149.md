# A malicious admin can use `setWithdrawSequence()` to temporarily disable `withdraw()` function

## Summary

The admin can set an inappropriate `withdrawSeq` to disable withdrawal. Users will not be able to call `withdraw()` function.

## Vulnerability Detail

The admin of AssetManager has the ability to call `setWithdrawSequence()` to set new `withdrawSeq`.
But `setWithdrawSequence()` lacks validation on `newSeq`, a malicious admin can use `setWithdrawSequence()` to disable `withdraw` function.

Assume that current `withdrawSeq.length` is 2, and only `moneyMarkets[1]` support `USDC` token. If a malicious admin set `withdrawSeq` to `[0, 0]`, users will not be able to withdraw `USDC` token because `moneyMarkets[0]` doesn't support `USDC` token.

## Impact

The malicious admin can disable withdraw function. Users will not be able to withdraw their tokens in money markets. It's high severity because users will lose funds in this case. But it's a centralized issue because only a malicious admin can exploit, so we think this issue is medium.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Check `newSeq` should contain all money market indexes, or only swap money market indexes in `withdrawSeq` in `setWithdrawSequence`.
