# When UToken.sol is paused borrowers cannot repay their loans but still accumulate interest on them

## Summary

When UToken.sol is paused borrowers cannot repay their loans. During this time they also accumulate interest which is unfair to borrower.

## Vulnerability Detail

    function repayBorrow(address borrower, uint256 repayAmount) external override whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
        _repayBorrowFresh(msg.sender, borrower, repayAmount);
    }

`UToken.sol#repayBorrow` has the modifier `whenNotPaused` which means it cannot be called when `UToken.sol` is paused. During this period of time the loan will continue to accumulate interest forcing the user to pay interest during a period of time that they couldn't repay their loan even if they wanted to.

## Impact

Borrower unfairly forced to pay interest
