# User can make PureTokenAdapter.sol support any type of token, including malicious token.

## Summary

PureTokenAdapter.sol support any type of token, including malicious token.

## Vulnerability Detail

User can send the ERC20 token directly into the pureAdapter.sol, then the modifier below always return True. 

```solidity
modifier checkTokenSupported(address tokenAddress) {
    if (!_supportsToken(tokenAddress)) revert TokenNotSupported();
    _;
}
```

because balanceOf is inflated by user.

```solidity
function _supportsToken(address tokenAddress) internal view returns (bool) {
    // Check if balanceOf reverst as a simple check to see if the token is ERC20 compatible
    // this is obviosly not a flawless check but it is good enough for the intention here
    return tokenAddress != address(0) && IERC20Upgradeable(tokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this)) >= 0;
}
```

## Impact

User can make PureTokenAdapter.sol support any type of token, including malicious token

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

I think this is Low because AssetManager.sol did use whitelist to manage the token.

```solidity
function isMarketSupported(address tokenAddress) public view override returns (bool) {
    return supportedMarkets[tokenAddress];
}
```

this whitelist check happens because of the money market level token support check.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/asset/AssetManager.sol#L278-L286

however, I do think the PureTokenAdapter should support any token of ERC20 token. Both AssetManager.sol and AaveV3Adapter.sol use the token whitelist approach. We recommend that the PureTokenAdapter.sol also use the same whitelist approach
