# It is impossible for the current block number to be less than the last updated block

## Summary
It is impossible for the current block number to be less than the last updated block.

## Vulnerability Detail
The code (See Comptroller.sol#L341-L343 and Comptroller.sol#L376-L378) is redundant as it can't be executed.

Imagine that the last updated block is updated some time ago (See Comptroller.sol#L263). When _getUserInfo function is called LATER, the block.number should be larger than the last updated block. Hence, it is impossible for `block.number < lastUpdatedBlock`

## Impact
deployment gas is wasted to include unnecessary code

      lastUpdatedBlock = block.number;
}
