# Staking Token Deprecated Function

## Summary

The staking token is used for underwriting loans and earns rewards from the comptroller. The approval mechanism for the staking ERC20 uses a deprecated method which could result in a race condition for users wishing to stake.

## Vulnerability Detail

`safeApprove()` is deprecated https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/2268 and its usage [is discouraged](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20Upgradeable.sol#L41).

Its implementation is vulnerable to a race condition. More information here: https://swcregistry.io/docs/SWC-114

## Impact

Users could be exposed to front running attacks.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
        erc20Token.safeApprove(assetManager, 0);
        erc20Token.safeApprove(assetManager, amount);
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Prevent a call to approve if all the previous tokens are not yet spent.
