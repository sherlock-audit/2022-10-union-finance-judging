# getUserInfo() returns incorrect values for locked and stakedAmount

## Summary

The `getUserInfo()` function mixes up the values for `locked` and `stakedAmount`, so the value for each of these is returned for the other.

## Vulnerability Detail

In UnionLens.sol, the `getUserInfo()` function is used to retrieve information about a given user.

In order to pull the user's staking information, the following function is called:

```solidity
(bool isMember, uint96 locked, uint96 stakedAmount) = userManager.stakers(user);
```

This function is intended to return these three values from the UserManager.sol contract. However, in that contract, the function being called returns a Staker struct, which has the following values:

```solidity
struct Staker {
    bool isMember;
    uint96 stakedAmount;
    uint96 locked;
}
```

Because both `locked` and `stakedAmount` have the type `uint96`, the function does not revert, and simply returns the incorrect values to the caller.

## Impact

Any user or front end calling the `getUserInfo()` function will be given incorrect values, which could lead to wrong decisions.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Reverse the order of return values in the `getUserInfo()` function, so that it reads:

```solidity
(bool isMember, uint96 stakedAmount, uint96 locked) = userManager.stakers(user);
```
