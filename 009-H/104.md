# Users won't be able to repay their overduе borrows, duo to a simple mistake made in the function `updateFrozenInfo`.

## Summary
Users won't be able to repay their overduе borrows, duo to a simple mistake made in the function `updateFrozenInfo`.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the function `_repayBorrowFresh()`, the if statement `if (isOverdue)` is triggered for borrowers that are paying back overdue balances, so the function `updateFrozenInfo()` is called to update their frozen balance and the global total frozen balance on the UserManager contract.

The problem here is that the function `updateFrozenInfo()` can be called only by the comptroller contract.
So every time the function is called by the uToken contract, it will revert.

As how it is right now, borrowers with overdue balances won't be able to repay back their borrows.
Because everytime the function `updateFrozenInfo()` is called by the uToken contract, it will revert.
And since `updateFrozenInfo()` reverts, the whole function `_repayBorrowFresh()` in the uToken contract will revert as well.

## Impact
Duo to the issue described in `Vulnerability Detail`, borrowers with overdue balances won't be able to repay back their borrows.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Fix the function `updateFrozenInfo()`, so it can be called by the uToken contract and the comptroller contract.
