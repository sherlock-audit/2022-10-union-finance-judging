# Overdue balances cannot be paid back

## Summary
`UserManager.updateFrozenInfo` is only callable by the Comptroller, but not by the UToken.

## Vulnerability Detail
`UserManager.updateFrozenInfo` has the modifier `onlyComptroller`, which restricts it to calls from the Comptroller (and reverts otherwise). However, the function is also called within UToken when an overdue balance is paid back:
```solidity
            if (isOverdue) {
                // For borrowers that are paying back overdue balances we need to update their
                // frozen balance and the global total frozen balance on the UserManager
                IUserManager(userManager).updateFrozenInfo(borrower, 0);
            }
```
Note that the tests do not catch this because a mock user manager is used that does not have this modifier for the `updateFrozenInfo` function.

## Impact
Whenever a user wants to pay back an overdue balance, the call will revert. It is therefore impossible for users to pay back their overdue balances.
