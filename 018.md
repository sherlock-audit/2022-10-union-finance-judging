# Incorrect Maximum Borrow Limit Calculation

## Summary

There is an upper bound to the maximum value a member may borrow of the underlying asset. The fee for loan origination is included in this calculation which means the maximum limit will never be reached.

## Vulnerability Detail

`UToken.borrow`

When a borrower requests a loan there is [a check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/market/UToken.sol#L520) to validate the borrower does not exceed the `maxBorrow`. This is set to ensure borrowers may only borrow up to a specific amount. Consider this scenario:

- A borrower has not borrowed before
- The origination fee is `5000000000000000` (`ethers.utils.parseUnits("0.005");`)
- A borrower requests 100 DAI, making the `amount` to equal `100000000000000000000`
- The loan origination fee is `500000000000000000` (`(originationFee * 100000000000000000000) / WAD;)`)
- The `maxBorrow` is set to 100 DAI which in wei is `100000000000000000000`
- The check for `maxBorrow` is calculated as: `0 + 100000000000000000000 (amount) + 500000000000000000 (fee)`
- This exceeds the maximum borrow amount as `100500000000000000000 > 100000000000000000000`. Though the configured limit is `100000000000000000000`, which has been requested by the borrower.

Borrowers should borrow principal and pay fees. They cannot borrow fees which this calculation is accounting for.

## Impact

- The borrower will never be able to reach their maximum borrow amount. 
- The platform misses out generating larger origination fees.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
if (borrowBalanceView(msg.sender) + amount + fee > maxBorrow) revert AmountExceedMaxBorrow();
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Remove the fee from this maximum borrow calculation as not to mix loan principal and loan fees into the borrower's maximum sum loan calculation

```solidity
if (borrowBalanceView(msg.sender) + amount > maxBorrow) revert AmountExceedMaxBorrow();
```
