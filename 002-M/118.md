# Fee on transfer token support

## Summary

Fee on transfer token (USDT could turn on transfer fee), the `stake()` and `_repayBorrowFresh()` function might not work.


## Vulnerability Detail

The process contains 2 step transfer. Firstly transfer from the user to the contract, and next deposit into assetManager contract.
For fee on transfer tokens, the actual transferred amount will be less, so in `stake()` the deposit to assetManager could fail. For `_repayBorrowFresh()` it is analogous.


## Impact

`stake()` and `_repayBorrowFresh()` functionality might not work.
For popular token like USDT, if the fee option is toggled on, many borrowers will be unable to repay and get penalized.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

In `stake()` and `_repayBorrowFresh()`, check the balance before and after the transferFrom, and deposit into assetManager the actual transferred amount.
