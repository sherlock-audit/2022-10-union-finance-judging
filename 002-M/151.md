# Fee-on-transfer tokens not handled consistently; can cause repayments to always revert

## Summary

The UToken contract is designed to handle fee-on-transfer tokens correctly during the `mint` and `addReserves`  function calls, but does not do so during `_repayBorrowFresh`. This will cause repayments to fail for these types of tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

To handle fee-on-transfer tokens correctly, the difference of balance before and after a token transfer needs to be checked. This is done in `mint` and `addReserves`:

```js
uint256 balanceBefore = assetToken.balanceOf(address(this));
assetToken.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), mintAmount);
uint256 balanceAfter = assetToken.balanceOf(address(this));
uint256 actualMintAmount = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
```
This is not done in `_repayBorrowFresh`: 
```js
IERC20Upgradeable(underlying).safeTransferFrom(payer, address(this), repayAmount);
_depositToAssetManager(repayAmount);
```

The `_depositToAssetManager` function will call `assetManager.deposit` which will attempt to perform another `safeTransferFrom` for the same value of `repayAmount` (either to money markets or to the AssetManager itself):

```js
// UToken._depositToAssetManager:
if (!IAssetManager(assetManager).deposit(underlying, amount)) revert DepositToAssetManagerFailed();

// AssetManager.deposit:
poolToken.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(moneyMarket), amount);
...
poolToken.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
```

Because the UToken contract wont have enough underlying tokens due to subtracted fees, the repayment will always revert for that type of tokens.

## Impact

Repayment impossible for underlying tokens that have a fee-on-transfer.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Perform the same logic of calculating the balance difference after a transfer as done in `mint` and `addReserves` for all other `safeTransferFrom` calls in `UToken` and `AssetManager`.
