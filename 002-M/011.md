# Use Change in balance Instead of user input in case of ERC20

## Summary
Exploit possible in staking , due to upgradeable nature of some ERC20 contracts , which can implement fee on transfer
## Vulnerability Detail
Some tokens take a transfer fee (e.g. `STA`,` PAXG`), some do not currently charge a fee but may do so in the future (e.g. `USDT`,` USDC`).

The STA transfer fee was used to drain $500k from several balancer pools ([more details](https://medium.com/@1inch.exchange/balancer-hack-2020-a8f7131c980e)).

## Impact
Can lead to mismanagement of accounting in the contract , which can be used to drain the contract of a good amount of funds.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use change in balance to update the  `stakedAmount` and `totalStaked ` variables , to correctly verify the amount of tokens the protocol actually receives and prudently be ready for any  transfer on fees in future.
