# Some contracts cannot handle fee-on-transfer tokens

## Summary

Although some contracts (`UToken` for example) can handle fee-on-transfer tokens, some other contracts (`UserManager`) cannot handle fee-on-transfer tokens.

If fee-on-transfer tokens are ever used contracts such as `UserManager`, there will be discrepancy between the accounting and the actual balance, resulting in loss of funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `UToken` contract can handle fee-on-transfer tokens. For example, `UToken::mint` function uses the difference between `balanceBefore` and `balanceAfter` to get the actual balance change from the `assetToken.safeTransferFrom`.

However, other contracts such as `UserManager::stake` cannot handle fee-on-transfer tokens, since it assumes all `amount` of `safeTransferFrom` was received:

There should be a clear guideline which tokens are supposed to be used with the protocols and which are not.

## Impact

If fee-on-transfer tokens are used, the contracts will assume that they got more than the actually transferred balances.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Either add the logic to handle fee-on-transfer tokens, or clearly outline fee-on-transfer tokens are not allowed.
