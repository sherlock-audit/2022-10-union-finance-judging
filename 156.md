# AssetManager.removeAdapter() should check that there are no remaining tokens in the adapter.

## Summary

`AssetManager.removeAdapter()` would remove the money market from AssetManager. It causes the loss of funds, if there are tokens that haven't been withdrawn from the money market. 

## Vulnerability Detail

`AssetManager.removeAdapter()` simply removes the money market from AssetManager.

```solidity
    function removeAdapter(address adapterAddress) external override onlyAdmin {
        bool isExist = false;
        uint256 index;
        uint256 moneyMarketsLength = moneyMarkets.length;

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < moneyMarketsLength; i++) {
            if (adapterAddress == address(moneyMarkets[i])) {
                isExist = true;
                index = i;
                break;
            }
        }

        if (isExist) {
            moneyMarkets[index] = moneyMarkets[moneyMarketsLength - 1];
            moneyMarkets.pop();
        }
    }    
```

However, it doesn’t check whether there are tokens remaining in the money market. those tokens could be lost permanently.

## Impact

`AssetManager.removeAdapter()` could cause the permanent loss of funds. A benign admin could accidentally do that. And a malicious admin can use this method to steal the funds.

It’s a serious issue, but only the admin can trigger it. So we label it medium

## Recommendation

Check the balance of the money market.

e.g.

```diff
    function removeAdapter(address adapterAddress) external override onlyAdmin {
        bool isExist = false;
        uint256 index;
        uint256 moneyMarketsLength = moneyMarkets.length;
+       uint256 supportedTokensLength = supportedTokensList.length;

+       for (uint256 i = 0; i < supportedTokensLength; i++) {
+           require(adapterAddress.getSupplyView(supportedTokensList[i]) == 0)
+       }

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < moneyMarketsLength; i++) {
            if (adapterAddress == address(moneyMarkets[i])) {
                isExist = true;
                index = i;
                break;
            }
        }

        if (isExist) {
            moneyMarkets[index] = moneyMarkets[moneyMarketsLength - 1];
            moneyMarkets.pop();
        }
    }  
```
