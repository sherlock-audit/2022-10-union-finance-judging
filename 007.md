# Vouches Cannot Be Cancelled By Users

## Summary

Both stakers/lenders and borrowers are unable to cancel a vouch after it has been provided. Vouches are used within the project to establish the amount of assets a borrower is trusted to borrow. If a lender changes their view on the borrower's suitability to borrow, or wishes to cancel a previously awarded vouch, they are unable to do so.

If a borrower wishes to cancel a vouch they have received, they are unable to do so.

The implementation does not match the statement from the docstring that either the borrower or the staker is able to cancel a vouch.

## Vulnerability Detail

`UserManager.cancelVouch`

Assume that a lender has address `0x0` and a borrower has address `0x1`.

On [line 578 ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/user/UserManager.sol#L578) there is a check to require that both the staker and the borrower are the calling party, `msg.sender`. This means that both the staker (lender) and borrower is required to be `msg.sender` to continue the vouch cancellation logic. 

If I as the lender decide to cancel the vouch and call `cancelVouch(0x0, 0x1)`, this call will fail and I will be unable to revoke the credit line. The same applies if I as the borrower wish to cancel a vouch I have received.

## Impact

- A lender is unable to effectively mange their risk as they cannot change their vouches after they have been given
- A borrower is unable to cancel the vouch, removing their ability to manage their creditors
- A vouch given to an erroneous address cannot be revoked resulting in an actor in the system being extended a line of credit unintentionally   

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function cancelVouch(address staker, address borrower) public onlyMember(msg.sender) whenNotPaused {
    if (staker != msg.sender && borrower != msg.sender) revert AuthFailed();
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The docstring indicates that either the borrower or the lender should be able to call this method. Implement the check using logical OR instead of logical AND:

```solidity
if (staker != msg.sender || borrower != msg.sender) revert AuthFailed();
```
