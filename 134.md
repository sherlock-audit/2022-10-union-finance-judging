# All implementations that inherit from Controller.sol can be destroyed, leading to loss of funds

## Summary
All of the protocol upgradeable contracts use UUPS, but don't implement a constructor with the ```initializer``` modifier or call ```_disableInitializers();``` to initialize the implementation. This leads to the basic uninitialized proxy bug, allowing anyone to initialize the implementation and destroy it using ```selfdestruct()```

## Vulnerability Detail
When a user initializes the implementation they can set themselves as admin by passing their own address to ```__Controller_init(address admin_)```.  Then they are able to pass the ```_authorizeUpgrade(address)``` check and call ```upgradeToAndCall()``` which performs a ```DELEGATECALL``` on the new implementation's initialize function. If the function contains a ```selfdestruct()```, the implementation will be destroyed, preventing further interactions with the contract functions and permanently locking the funds held in the contract.

## Impact
If the implementation contract is destroyed, all of the funds inside the contract will be permanently locked since there is no way to update the implementation. This issue affects Comptroller.sol, UserManager.sol, UserManagerDAI.sol, UserManagerERC20.sol, MarketRegistry.sol, UToken.sol, UDAI.sol, AaveV3Adapter.sol, AssetManager.sol, PureTokenAdapter.sol.

It also affects multiple currently deployed implementations on Eth Mainnet and Arbitrum.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
/* -------------------------------------------------------------------
      Constructor/Initializer 
    ------------------------------------------------------------------- */

    // Missing constructor

    //When using minimal deploy, do not call initialize directly during deploy, because msg.sender is the proxyFactory address, and you need to call it manually
    function __Controller_init(address admin_) public initializer {
        _paused = false;
        admin = admin_;
        __UUPSUpgradeable_init();
        pauseGuardian = admin_;
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Initialize the deployed implementations by calling their respective initialize functions, setting the admin to a trusted address or some address which is very unlikely to have an associated EOA (for example address(0)).

Include 
```solidity
/// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
  constructor() {
      _disableInitializers();
  }
 ``` 
 in future implementation contracts.
