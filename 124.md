# UToken.sol#debtWriteOff should accrueInterest first

## Summary

UToken.sol#accrueInterest should accrueInterest first

## Vulnerability Detail

Every write function in Utoken accrueInterest first except debtWriteOff.

```solidity
    function debtWriteOff(address borrower, uint256 amount) external override whenNotPaused onlyUserManager {
        uint256 oldPrincipal = getBorrowed(borrower);
        uint256 repayAmount = amount > oldPrincipal ? oldPrincipal : amount;

        accountBorrows[borrower].principal = oldPrincipal - repayAmount;
        totalBorrows -= repayAmount;
    }
```

The interest should also be considered as a part of debt in accounting!



## Impact

UToken.sol#accrueInterest should accrueInterest first, otherwise, a part of the interest generated from borrowing does not count towards debt.
