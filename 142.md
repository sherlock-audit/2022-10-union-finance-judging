# A stake that has just been locked gets full reward multiplier

## Summary
A staker gets rewarded with full multiplier even if its stake has just been locked. Multiplier calculation should take into account the duration of the lock.

## Vulnerability Detail

1. A staker stakes an amount of tokens. 
2. The staker waits for some time
3. The staker has control of another member (bribe, ...)
4. The staker vouches this other member
5. The member borrows
6. The staker calls `Comptroller:withdrawRewards` and gets an amount of rewards with a multiplier corresponding to a locked stake
7. The member repays the loan

Note that steps 4 to 7 can be made in one tx, so no interest is paid at step 7.

The result is that the staker can always get the full multiplier for rewards, without ever putting any funds at risk, nor any interest being paid. This is done at the expense of other honest stakers, who get proprotionally less of the rewards dripped into the comptroller.

For a coded PoC replace the test `"staker with locked balance gets more rewards"` in `staking.ts` with the following

```typescript
        it("PoC: staker with locked balance gets more rewards even when just locked", async () => {
            const trustAmount = parseUnits("2000");
            const borrowAmount = parseUnits("1800");
            const [account, staker, borrower] = members;

            const [accountStaked, borrowerStaked, stakerStaked] = await helpers.getStakedAmounts(
                account,
                staker,
                borrower
            );

            expect(accountStaked).eq(borrowerStaked);
            expect(borrowerStaked).eq(stakerStaked);

            await helpers.updateTrust(staker, borrower, trustAmount);
            
            await roll(10);
            await helpers.borrow(borrower, borrowAmount); // borrows just after withdrawing
            
            const [accountMultiplier, stakerMultiplier] = await helpers.getRewardsMultipliers(account, staker);
            console.log("accountMultiplier: ", accountMultiplier);
            console.log("StakerMultiplier: ", stakerMultiplier);
            expect(accountMultiplier).lt(stakerMultiplier);  // the multiplier is larger even if just locked
        });
```

## Impact
A staker can get larger rewards designed for locked stakes by locking and unlocking in the same tx.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/token/Comptroller.sol#L166-L173

```solidity
    function getRewardsMultiplier(address account, address token) external view override returns (uint256) {
        IUserManager userManagerContract = _getUserManager(token);
        uint256 stakingAmount = userManagerContract.getStakerBalance(account);
        uint256 lockedStake = userManagerContract.getTotalLockedStake(account);
        (uint256 totalFrozen, ) = userManagerContract.getFrozenInfo(account, block.number);
        bool isMember = userManagerContract.checkIsMember(account);
        return _getRewardsMultiplier(stakingAmount, lockedStake, totalFrozen, isMember);
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Should introduce the accounting of the duration of a lock into the rewards calculation, so that full multiplier is given only to a lock that is as old as the stake itself.
