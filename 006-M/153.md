# `removeAdapter()` doesn't pop the market index in `withdrawSeq`, leading to users not being able to call withdraw

## Summary

Admin can remove adapters in AssetManager, but `removeAdapter()` doesn’t remove the market index from `withdrawSeq`. It will be reverted when users call `withdraw()` due to the non-exist index.

## Vulnerability Detail

`removeAdapter()` removes an adapter from `moneyMarkets[]`:

```solidity
    function removeAdapter(address adapterAddress) external override onlyAdmin {
        bool isExist = false;
        uint256 index;
        uint256 moneyMarketsLength = moneyMarkets.length;

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < moneyMarketsLength; i++) {
            if (adapterAddress == address(moneyMarkets[i])) {
                isExist = true;
                index = i;
                break;
            }
        }

        if (isExist) {
            moneyMarkets[index] = moneyMarkets[moneyMarketsLength - 1];
            moneyMarkets.pop();
        }
    }
```

Because `addAdapter()` also push market index into `withdrawSeq` in [L430](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/asset/AssetManager.sol#L430), `removeAdapter()` should also remove the market index (index of moneyMarkets[]) from `withdrawSeq`.

## Impact

If `removeAdapter()` doesn’t remove the market index from `withdrawSeq`, users will not be able to call `withdraw` function due to the non-exist index in [L349](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/asset/AssetManager.sol#L349).
