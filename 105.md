# A staker can make sure that no one will be able to write off the debt with his locked stake.

## Summary
A staker can make sure, that no one will be able to call the function `debtWriteOff` in the UserManager contract after 
`block.number > lastRepay + overdueBlocks + maxOverdueBlocks`
As result the borrower's debt can't be written off using the stakers locked stake. 
The only way for the debt to be gone is if the borrower repays it back to the staker.

When the staker sees that the time is getting closer for the function `debtWriteOff` to be public and the borrower won't be able to pay it back in time. The staker can perform the issue described in `Vulnerability Detail`, so other users won't be able to write off the debt using his locked stake. 

## Vulnerability Detail
As for the example, we have two people Kiki and Jake:
Kiki has a stake of 10 000 Dai, he trusts Jake so he vouches the 10 000 Dai to him.
Jake successfuly borrowed the amount, as a result Kiki's stake of 10 000 Dai is locked.

Time passes and so far Jake repaid only 5 000 Dai back, as the time is getting closer for the function `debtWriteOff` to be public in the contract UserManager. Kiki understands that Jake won't be able to repay back the full loan in time.

Kiki doesn't want to lose his stake, by someone writing off the debt. So he unstakes the repaid amount by Jake and calls the function `debtWriteOff` in the AssetManager contract and writes off out of his stake balance Jake's unpaid debt of 5 000 Dai. 
The outcome of this will look like this:

`balances[msg.sender][token] -= amount;` => `5 000 -= 5 000` => `balances[msg.sender][token] = 0`

After this actions Kiki will have zero amount left in the mapping `balances` allocated in AssetManager.

As a result when people try to call the function `debtWriteOff` in the UserManager contract to write off the debt. 
It will revert because the function calls `debtWriteOff` in AssetManager to subtract the debt amount from Kiki's balance.
And since Kiki's balance is zero, the function `debtWriteOff` in UserManager will always revert.

Jake has no choice left, he either has to repay the debt or he won't be able to borrow anymore.

`You may ask these questions:`
1. Why would the staker do all of this.
2. How the staker will be able to unstake his funds, even if the borrower repays them back, as his balance will be zero in AssetManager.

1 - If the staker sees that the borrower has no intentions to pay back the loan, as the debt can be just written off with staker's locked funds. The staker can perfom the issue, so the borrower won't be able to borrow anymore until he repays back the amount.

2 - As the `stakedAmount` will remain in UserManager, when the borrower repays back, the staker can vouch the funds to someone he knows or he can create a second wallet and vouch them to himself. The staker will be able to get back his funds by borrowing them.

## Impact
With the issue described in `Vulnerability Detail`, a staker can make sure that no one will be able to write off the debt using his locked stake. 

The staker has nothing else to lose, as he sees that the borrower won't pay the debt and his locked stake funds will be used to write off the debt. He can perform the issue to make sure the borrower won't be able to borrow anymore until he pays back, even if the borrower doesn't repay back. The debt can't be written off by anyone and will stay forever.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To fix this issue, make sure the function `debtWriteOff` in AssetManager can be called only by the UserManager contract.
