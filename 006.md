# First depositer can mint 100 million uDai shares for free.

## Summary
By following the described issue - a malicious attack will mint 1/1000 of the uDai supply, which is equivalent to 1 million Dai tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
The outcome of this exploit can be different, it depends on how many tokens the attacker will use. 
The bigger the amount is, the bigger the minted shares will be and etc:
Attacker uses 20 Dai tokens => 10k shares of uDai minted.
Attacker uses 200 Dai tokens  => 100k shares of uDai minted.
Attacker uses 2000 Dai tokens => 1 million shares of uDai minted.
Attacker uses 20000 Dai tokens => 10 million shares of uDai minted.

l am just giving an example, when the attacker spends 2000 Dai tokens to get 10 million uDai shares. 

An exploit can occur, when the `tokenSupply()` equals to zero. Malicious attacker can take advantage of that moment and directly transfer 1000 Dai tokens to the contract AssetManger. 

This actions will break the function `exchangeRateStored()`. When the function is called and the `tokenSupply()` is zero, it is supposed to return `initialExchangeRateMantissa`, but duo to the direct transfer of tokens from the attacker, `exchangeRateStored()` will return `(totalRedeemable * WAD) / totalSupply_`.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/market/UToken.sol#L454-L456

Since `totalRedeemable` equals zero and everything multiplied by zero is zero. 
`(totalRedeemable * WAD) / totalSupply_` = 0

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/market/UToken.sol#L456

The function `mint()` will revert, when calculating `mintTokens`, because `exchangeRate` will be equal to a zero, and a case with dividing an amount with zero won't be handled and will always revert.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/market/UToken.sol#L691

// To call the function `borrow()` and borrow the given amount, he need someone who vouched for him with an active Stake. 
// The stake needs to be equal or greater than the borrowing amount. 
// Since i don't know the real number of `minBorrow`, l am assuming it will be 1 - if it's 1, the attacker will steal 1 million shares.
// if the `minBorrow` is 10, the attacker can steal 100k shares. and etc...

No one will be able to deposit any tokens until the attack is done, because the function `mint()` will revert.
Then the malicious attacker calls the function `borrow()` and borrows 1 Dai token from the `tokenSupply()`.
After that he calls the function `repayBorrow()` to repay it. The function will add the amount of 1 token to the total amount of `totalRedeemable`. 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/market/UToken.sol#L635

The attacker calls the function `mint()` to deposit 1000 Dai tokens, the exploit happens when the amount of `mintTokens` is calculated.
It will be calculated based on the formula: `(actualMintAmount * WAD) / exchangeRate` = `(1000 * 1e18) / exchangeRate`. 
Since `totalRedeemable` equals 1, the outcome of the function `exchangeRateStored()` will be way different.
it will equal to `(totalRedeemable * WAD) / totalSupply_` = `(1 * 1e18) / 1000 = 1 000 000`
`minTokens` will be equal to `(1000 * 1e18) / 1 000 000` = `1 000 000`. 
The function will successfuly mint 1 million uDai tokens to the attacker.

The attacker already has the 1 million shares, he calls the function `borrow()` to borrow the `totalSupply()` of 2000 tokens he deposited. 
So the function `exchangeRateStored()` can get back to normal and return the `initialExchangeRateMantissa`, when the `tokenSupply()` equals zero. This way any deposited amount with the `mint()` function will be calculated normally. 

With following this scenario the attacker can steal any deposited amount of Dai in the AssetManager contract, and successfuly `redeem()` up to 1 million of Dai from the minted shares. From only 2000 tokens the attacker was able to get 1 million uDai shares, which are equivalent to 1 million Dai (1 million dollars).

## Impact
With the issue described in "Vulnerability Detail", a malicious attacker will be able to mint 1 million uDai shares, which he can `redeem()` by stealing from other users's deposited amount of Dai in the contract AssetManager.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
My recommended changes for the owner are:
1. To deposit an amount of tokens with the function `mint()`, so the deposited amount can be calculated with `initialExchangeRateMantissa` and to leave the tokens in the contract.
2. Or he can create a require() statement in the function `exchangeRateStored()`, which will revert if `totalRedeemable` equals zero: https://gist.github.com/CodingNameKiki/306de1c16614d6547e864a53f5c6d4b4
