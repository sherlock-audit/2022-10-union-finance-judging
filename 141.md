# Possible DoS on contracts due to initialized Controller

## Summary
Contracts making an external call to Controller.__Controller_init() would revert if Controller is already initialized.

## Vulnerability Detail
The following contracts make an external call to Controller.__Controller_init() in their initialization functions;

- AaveV3Adapter
- AssetManager
- PureTokenAdapter
- MarketRegistry
- UToken
- Comptroller
- UserManager

Once Controller is initialized by any contract or a user, every other contract making the external call to Controller.__Controller_init() would revert is Controller has already being initialized.

## Impact
Inability for some contracts to be initialized.

## Code Snippet

The following are locations where the external call to initialize Controller are made.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
It may be necessary to remove the external call to initialize the controller in the contracts above, while at same time implementing access control for Controller.__Controller_init()
