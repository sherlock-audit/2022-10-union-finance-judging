# `uTokens[]` upgrade could lock users fund

## Summary

`uToken` is upgradable, if the address of existing uToken is changed in the registry, the `balances[][]` accounting will be wrong, hence users fund could get locked and cannot be withdrawn. 


## Vulnerability Detail

`uTokens[token]` could be changed in MarketRegistry, then the previous tToken address will be treated as normal users.
Users could fail to `redeem()` from the previous uToken. Because it calls the `AssetManager.withdraw()`, and the `_checkSenderBalance()` will return false and revert.

Some of the previous uToken functions can still be called, like `mint()`. If mistakenly `mint()` and deposited into the assetManager, the fund could be stolen by other users by calling `redeem()`. Because in this case, the balance of the uToken will be positive.


## Impact

- `balances[][]` accounting will be inaccurate, `_checkSenderBalance()` will return wrong results
- users fund being locked
- some users fund could be stolen

The previous uToken will be treated as normal user.

`_checkSenderBalance()` will execute the wrong logic.

## Tool used

Manual Review


## Recommendation

- maybe maintain some obsolete list of uTokens
- provide methods to migrate fund from previous uToken
- separate the logic for users and uToken in `_checkSenderBalance()`, it is confusing
