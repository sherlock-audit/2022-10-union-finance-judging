# UserManger#cancelVouch incomplete logic mixes up index after vouch is removed

## Summary 

When a vouch is removed it's position is swapped with the vouch in the final spot of the vouch array. The function fails to update the index of the swapped vouch. The result is that the index of the vouch no longer reflects is position inside the borrower and staker arrays.

## Vulnerability Detail

        Index memory voucherIndex = voucherIndexes[borrower][staker];
        if (!voucherIndex.isSet) revert VoucherNotFound();

        Vouch memory vouch = vouchers[borrower][voucherIndex.idx];
        if (vouch.locked > 0) revert LockedStakeNonZero();

        vouchers[borrower][voucherIndex.idx] = vouchers[borrower][vouchers[borrower].length - 1];
        vouchers[borrower].pop();
        delete voucherIndexes[borrower][staker];

When a vouch is removed the function uses a swap and pop method to remove the vouch from the array. The `voucherIndex` contains the position of the vouch in the `vouchers[borrower]` array. After the swap the voucher index of the swapped vouch (which used to be at the end of the array) still stores its position as `vouchers.length - 1` but it has been swapped so it's true index is that of the removed vouch. 

The same issue also exists with the updated `vouchees[staker]` array.

## Impact

The owner of the swapped voucher will not be able to cancel their vouch and the vouch array will be permanently mixed up

## Recommendation

Update the index of the swapped vouch to reflect it's new position in both the `vouchers[borrower]` and `vouchees[staker]` arrays.
