# Rewards can be gathered by an overdue staker

## Summary

A borrower can become the staker and gather rewards from the system without paying the corresponding interest. If UNION token value be high enough this will constitute an arbitrage, that generally harms the system by bloating usage values.

## Vulnerability Detail

A borrower can borrow maximal amount available, stake to get rewards, then reap rewards and either return (if profitable based on rewards market value) or leave the system altogether. As the latter case is just bas borrower behavior, the former is a kinf of arbitrage that harm the system and should be controlled.

## Impact

Reward can be gathered by overdue borrowers who are also a stakers, diluting the shares of healthy stakers.

## Code Snippet

There is no control for the staker to be in a good health to get the rewards:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/user/UserManager.sol#L710-L715

```solidity
    /**
     *  @dev collect staker rewards from the comptroller
     */
    function withdrawRewards() external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
        comptroller.withdrawRewards(msg.sender, stakingToken);
    }
```

Now only the creation of the new trust is prohibited for the case of overdue staker:

UserManager's updateTrust():

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/user/UserManager.sol#L541-L543

```solidity
            // If the member is overdue they cannot create new vouches they can
            // only update existing vouches
            if (uToken.checkIsOverdue(staker)) revert VouchWhenOverdue();
```

If the staker needs to be restricted it looks like this should be done more widely, first of all porohibiting reward gathering.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider adding `uToken.checkIsOverdue(msg.sender)` as a staker's health check to the UserManager's withdrawRewards():

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/user/UserManager.sol#L710-L715

```solidity
    /**
     *  @dev collect staker rewards from the comptroller
     */
    function withdrawRewards() external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
+	if (uToken.checkIsOverdue(msg.sender)) revert VouchWhenOverdue(); // add new error
        comptroller.withdrawRewards(msg.sender, stakingToken);
    }
```
