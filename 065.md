# AssetManager.removeAdapter: Adapter not removed from withdrawSeq

## Summary
When an adapter is removed, the corresponding entry is not removed form `withdrawSeq`, causing a revert on withdrawals 

## Vulnerability Detail
In `AssetManager`, the indices of the adapters are added to the list `withdrawSeq`. However, when an adapter is removed using `removeAdapter`, the indices are not updated. Therefore, `moneyMarketsLength - 1` (that now no longer exists) and `index` (that now refers to another adapter, because positions were swapped) will still be in the list.

## Impact
Because `withdraw` iterates over the whole `withdrawSeq` list and accesses these indices, this will cause an out-of-bounds access there, meaning that withdrawals revert.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change the two indices (removal & update) within `withdrawSeq` when removing an adapter.
