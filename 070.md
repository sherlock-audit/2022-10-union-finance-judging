# The `first in First out` system could be manipulated by the users

## Summary
if Alice is the last one was on `vouchers[]` and Bob is the first 
Bob can invoke `cancelVouch()` and Alice will be the first on `vouchers[]` on transaction

## Vulnerability Detail
On `UserManager.sol` ==> `cancelVouch()`
When someone cancels his vouch. 
The `cancelVouch()` will replace it with the last one on `vouchers[]`
```solidity
vouchers[borrower][voucherIndex.idx] = vouchers[borrower][vouchers[borrower].length - 1]
```  
And delete the last one 
```solidity
vouchers[borrower].pop()
``` 
now the order of `vouchers[borrower]` change.

On `UToken.sol` ==> `borrow()` 
```solidity
IUserManager(userManager).updateLocked(msg.sender, uint96(amount + fee), true);
```

And on `UToken.sol` ==> `repayBorrow()` 
```solidity
IUserManager(userManager).updateLocked(borrower, uint96(repayAmount - interest), false);
```
These to lines invoking `updateLocked()` on `UserManager.sol`
 And on NatSpec Comment we find this 
```solidity
/**
*@dev Locks/Unlocks the borrowers stakers staked amounts in a first in First out order
*
```
And this how it works
```solidity
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < vouchers[borrower].length; i++) {
            Vouch storage vouch = vouchers[borrower][i];
```
But because the `cancelVouch()` was changed the order, the NatSpec Comment is no longer true

## Impact
The last one on `vouchers[]` will be no longer the last, and this could lead to
 Destroy the `first in First out` system in the two cases `borrow()` or `repayBorrow()`, depending on when `cancelVouch` was invoked.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function cancelVouch(address staker, address borrower) public onlyMember(msg.sender) whenNotPaused {
        if (staker != msg.sender && borrower != msg.sender) revert AuthFailed();

        Index memory voucherIndex = voucherIndexes[borrower][staker];
        if (!voucherIndex.isSet) revert VoucherNotFound();

        Vouch memory vouch = vouchers[borrower][voucherIndex.idx];
        if (vouch.locked > 0) revert LockedStakeNonZero();

        vouchers[borrower][voucherIndex.idx] = vouchers[borrower][vouchers[borrower].length - 1];
        vouchers[borrower].pop();

```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
You can limit the number of  vouchers for every borrower, then you can `cancelVouch()` and keep the order by replacing them one by one
