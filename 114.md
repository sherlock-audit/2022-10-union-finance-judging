# Stakers can have their funds locked for an extended period not related to the performance of their borrowers

## Summary

Some stakers will have their funds lent locked for an extended period of time as partial prepayments to vouch logic (i.e. what vouch to prepay if a borrower provided the funds) depends on vouch order in the borrower's `vouchers` array, while cancelVouch() breaks up the FIFO vouch order it initially was build on. 

## Vulnerability Detail

While voucher array is initially ordered to favor the older lenders, i.e. in FIFO order, this initial order gets broken up over time as cancelVouch() places the very last lender (i.e. one who entered the latest) to the position of the removed one. This is a standard take on array element removal, which violates the redemption business logic in this case.

As a result stakers whose borrowers pay interest in full and do partial redemptions will have their funds locked with the lower priority in the prepayment queue just because some older vouch gets removed and a big vouch from the very end was moved before them.

Say Mike the lender was `2nd` lender for Alice the borrower, who borrowed more funds from various stakers over time, say `5` in total, and have Bob the big lender placed `5th` on her vouchers array as he entered the last.

Now Jade, Alice's `1st` lender, decided to remove the trust as she got payed back in full and the funds are needed elsewhere. `cancelVouch(Jade, Alice)` was called and Alice vouch array length is reduced to be `4`.

Bob gets placed `1st`, Mike is still `2nd`. Now suppose Mike lent Alice 1 year ago and it was `1k DAI`, while Bob lender yesterday and it was `10k DAI`. Now Alice prepayments will go towards Bob instead of Mike, who has his funds frozen until (and if) Bob's part be payed in full.

## Impact

Net impact is temporal funds freeze if Alice remains to be in good health, and permanent fund freeze if Alice stops paying before Mike's turn of the redemptions. I.e. the prepayment order can determine if Mike loan end up being paid or not. Bob has his situation improved on Mike's behalf, who has worsened perspectives of the overall repayment.

This funds freeze is conditional on cancelVouch() calls, but as it needs to be run with ordinary parameters (i.e. remove **any** old vouch) and it is a typical operation (it will be run from time to time by stakers as their `vouchees` array has limited size), while core UNION logic of lender to borrower correspondence is broken here, so setting the severity to be **high**.

## Code Snippet

cancelVouch() switches the vouch being removed with the last one: 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/user/UserManager.sol#L577-L591

```solidity
    function cancelVouch(address staker, address borrower) public onlyMember(msg.sender) whenNotPaused {
        if (staker != msg.sender && borrower != msg.sender) revert AuthFailed();

        Index memory voucherIndex = voucherIndexes[borrower][staker];
        if (!voucherIndex.isSet) revert VoucherNotFound();

        // Check that the locked amount for this vouch is 0
        Vouch memory vouch = vouchers[borrower][voucherIndex.idx];
        if (vouch.locked > 0) revert LockedStakeNonZero();

        // Remove borrower from vouchers array by moving the last item into the position
        // of the index being removed and then poping the last item off the array
        vouchers[borrower][voucherIndex.idx] = vouchers[borrower][vouchers[borrower].length - 1];
        vouchers[borrower].pop();
        delete voucherIndexes[borrower][staker];
```

This logic is the classic take on array removal, but `vouchers[borrower]` array order is material, being used in updateLocked() assuming that array index is a good proxy for loan age, and adhering to the first in, first out logic:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/user/UserManager.sol#L800-L841

```solidity
    function updateLocked(
        address borrower,
        uint96 amount,
        bool lock
    ) external onlyMarket {
        uint96 remaining = amount;

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < vouchers[borrower].length; i++) {
            Vouch storage vouch = vouchers[borrower][i];
            uint96 innerAmount;

            if (lock) {
                // Look up the staker and determine how much unlock stake they
                // have available for the borrower to borrow. If there is 0
                // then continue to the next voucher in the array
                uint96 stakerLocked = stakers[vouch.staker].locked;
                uint96 stakerStakedAmount = stakers[vouch.staker].stakedAmount;
                uint96 availableStake = stakerStakedAmount - stakerLocked;
                uint96 lockAmount = _min(availableStake, vouch.trust - vouch.locked);
                if (lockAmount == 0) continue;

                // Calculate the amount to add to the lock then
                // add the extra amount to lock to the stakers locked amount
                // and also update the vouches locked amount and lastUpdated block
                innerAmount = _min(remaining, lockAmount);
                stakers[vouch.staker].locked = stakerLocked + innerAmount;
                vouch.locked += innerAmount;
                vouch.lastUpdated = uint64(block.number);
            } else {
                // Look up how much this vouch has locked. If it is 0 then
                // continue to the next voucher. Then calculate the amount to
                // unlock which is the min of the vouches lock and what is
                // remaining to unlock
                uint96 locked = vouch.locked;
                if (locked == 0) continue;
                innerAmount = _min(locked, remaining);

                // Update the stored locked values and last updated block
                stakers[vouch.staker].locked -= innerAmount;
                vouch.locked -= innerAmount;
                vouch.lastUpdated = uint64(block.number);
            }
```

updateLocked() is called when a borrower repays current debt interest in full:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/market/UToken.sol#L573-L619

```solidity
    function _repayBorrowFresh(
        address payer,
        address borrower,
        uint256 amount
    ) internal {
        if (!accrueInterest()) revert AccrueInterestFailed();

        uint256 interest = calculatingInterest(borrower);
        uint256 borrowedAmount = borrowBalanceStoredInternal(borrower);
        uint256 repayAmount = amount > borrowedAmount ? borrowedAmount : amount;
        if (repayAmount == 0) revert AmountZero();

        uint256 toReserveAmount;
        uint256 toRedeemableAmount;

        if (repayAmount >= interest) {
        	...

            // Call update locked on the userManager to lock this borrowers stakers. This function
            // will revert if the account does not have enough vouchers to cover the repay amount. ie
            // the borrower is trying to repay more than is locked (owed)
            IUserManager(userManager).updateLocked(borrower, uint96(repayAmount - interest), false);
```

Which vouch to be updated by updateLocked(), i.e. where to allocate this new repayment if a borrower has many locked vouches, is material as it determines who gets the money back:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/user/UserManager.sol#L432-L466

```solidity
    /**
     *  @dev Get frozen coin age
     *  @param  staker Address of staker
     *  @param  pastBlocks Number of blocks past to calculate coin age from
     *          coin age = min(block.number - lastUpdated, pastBlocks) * amount
     */
    function getFrozenInfo(address staker, uint256 pastBlocks)
        public
        view
        returns (uint256 memberTotalFrozen, uint256 memberFrozenCoinAge)
    {
        uint256 overdueBlocks = uToken.overdueBlocks();
        uint256 voucheesLength = vouchees[staker].length;
        // Loop through all of the stakers vouchees sum their total
        // locked balance and sum their total memberFrozenCoinAge
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < voucheesLength; i++) {
            // Get the vouchee record and look up the borrowers voucher record
            // to get the locked amount and lastUpdate block number
            Vouchee memory vouchee = vouchees[staker][i];
            Vouch memory vouch = vouchers[vouchee.borrower][vouchee.voucherIndex];

            uint256 lastUpdated = vouch.lastUpdated;
            uint256 diff = block.number - lastUpdated;

            if (overdueBlocks < diff) {
                uint96 locked = vouch.locked;
                memberTotalFrozen += locked;
                if (pastBlocks >= diff) {
                    memberFrozenCoinAge += (locked * diff);
                } else {
                    memberFrozenCoinAge += (locked * pastBlocks);
                }
            }
        }
    }
```

This can mean who gets the money faster or who gets the money at all, depending on the future behavior of the borrower.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

A simplest solution is to do it in a hard way and cycle through the whole array, for example:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/user/UserManager.sol#L577-L591

```solidity
    function cancelVouch(address staker, address borrower) public onlyMember(msg.sender) whenNotPaused {
        if (staker != msg.sender && borrower != msg.sender) revert AuthFailed();

        Index memory voucherIndex = voucherIndexes[borrower][staker];
        if (!voucherIndex.isSet) revert VoucherNotFound();

        // Check that the locked amount for this vouch is 0
        Vouch memory vouch = vouchers[borrower][voucherIndex.idx];
        if (vouch.locked > 0) revert LockedStakeNonZero();

        // Remove borrower from vouchers array by moving the last item into the position
        // of the index being removed and then poping the last item off the array
+	... // create new empty array
+       for (uint256 i = 0; i < vouchers[borrower].length; i++) {
+           Vouch storage vouch = vouchers[borrower][i];
+           ... // if `i <> voucherIndex.idx` and vouch has positive trust put it to the new array
+	for (uint256 i = 0; i < vouchers[borrower].length; i++) {
+           Vouch storage vouch = vouchers[borrower][i];
+	    ... // if `i <> voucherIndex.idx` and vouch has zero trust put it to the new array, keeping the old order among them this way
+	... // replace old `vouches` with new array
-       vouchers[borrower][voucherIndex.idx] = vouchers[borrower][vouchers[borrower].length - 1];
-       vouchers[borrower].pop();

        delete voucherIndexes[borrower][staker];
```

It can be feasible as `vouchers` length will not be big in the most cases, cancelVouch() isn't that frequent, and loan order is material for business logic to bear additional gas costs.

Also, this reorganisation of non-zero vouches first, zeros later eliminates the potential issue with stakers leaving vouchers with zero amounts just to keep the place in the redemption queue, which also doesn't adhere to FIFO logic.
