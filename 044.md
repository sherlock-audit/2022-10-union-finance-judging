# Rebalancing will always fail

## Summary
Rebalancing of assets in Money manager will always fail due to incorrect condition as shown in POC

## Vulnerability Detail
1. For simplicity sake say their is only 2 money market
2. rebalance function is called by Admin with percentages as 50%,50%
3. Ideally fund should get divided equally between both supported money market. Below are variables:

```python
percentagesLength = percentages.length = 2
supportedMoneyMarketsSize = 2
```

4. But this will fail because of below condition

```python
if (percentagesLength + 1 != supportedMoneyMarketsSize) revert NotParity();
// 2+1!=2 => 3!=2 => revert
```

## Impact
Rebalance function will not work. Admin will not be able to rebalance funds as per his choice in money market to make profits
