# Comptroller.withdrawRewards: totalFrozen subtracted two times from totalStaked

## Summary
In `Comptroller.withdrawRewards`, `userManagerState.totalFrozen` is subtracted two times from `totalStaked`, leading to a wrong inflation index or even a broken system because the calculation underflows.

## Vulnerability Detail
`_getUserManagerState` calculates the `totalStaked` like this:
```solidity
        userManagerState.totalFrozen = userManager.totalFrozen();
        userManagerState.totalStaked = userManager.totalStaked() - userManagerState.totalFrozen;
```
`totalStaked` is therefore already set to `totalStaked - totalFrozen`. However, in `withdrawRewards`, the following calculation is performed:
```solidity
uint256 totalStaked_ = userManagerState.totalStaked - userManagerState.totalFrozen;
```
`totalFrozen` is therefore subtracted from `totalStaked` again, meaning we have:
```solidity
totalStaked_ = userManager.totalStaked() - userManagerState.totalFrozen() - userManagerState.totalFrozen()
```

## Impact
When `userManagerState.totalFrozen()` is sufficiently large, this can lead to an underflow, meaning that `withdrawRewards` (and therefore `UserManager.stake`, `UserManager.unstake`, and `UserManager.withdrawRewards`) can never be executed, which bricks the system. But even if it does not underflow, the following update of `gInflationIndex` will use a wrong value.
