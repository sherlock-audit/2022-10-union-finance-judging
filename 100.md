# User's increased debt may be larger than expected

## Summary
In UToken.borrow, when the fee is increased, the user's increased debt may be greater than expected
## Vulnerability Detail
In UToken.borrow, the user's increased debt is amount+fee, where fee is determined by originationFee, and if originationFee suddenly increases, the user's increased debt will be larger than expected
## Impact
User's increased debt may be larger than expected
