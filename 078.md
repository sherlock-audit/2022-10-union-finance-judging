# The vouch from members with no active staking power stills count as effective when registering a new member.

## Summary

The vouch from members with no active staking power still count when registering a new member.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a new member is registered, the code loops through all the vouchers and checks if the vouchers have the stake balance.

```solidity
uint256 count = 0;
uint256 vouchersLength = vouchers[newMember].length;

// Loop through all the vouchers to count how many active vouches there
// are that are greater than 0. Vouch is the min of stake and trust
for (uint256 i = 0; i < vouchersLength; i++) {
    Vouch memory vouch = vouchers[newMember][i];
    Staker memory staker = stakers[vouch.staker];
    if (staker.stakedAmount > 0) count++;
    if (count >= effectiveCount) break;
}
```

note we only check

```solidity
if (staker.stakedAmount > 0) count++;
```

However, having a staking amount does not mean that the staking amount is effective. The staked amount can be borrowed by other user and the staker's staking amount can be fully locked.

In the function unstaking, we check if we have sufficient amount to unstake using the logic

```solidity
// Stakers can only unstaked stake balance that is unlocked. Stake balance
// becomes locked when it is used to underwrite a borrow.
if (staker.stakedAmount - staker.locked < amount) revert InsufficientBalance();
```

I think we need the same check when checking if a staker's staking amount is effective.

```solidity
if (staker.stakedAmount - staker.locked > 0) count++;
```

## Impact

The vouch from members with no active staking power still count when registering a new member but the vouch from member with no active staking should not count towards the effective count.

## Recommendation

We recommend changing from

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/user/UserManager.sol#L643-L644

to 

```solidity
Staker memory staker = stakers[vouch.staker];
if (staker.stakedAmount - staker.locked > 0) count++;
if (count >= effectiveCount) break;
```
