# Incorrect inflation index due to incorrect calculation of ```totalStaked```

## Summary

The ```gInflationIndex``` in ```Comptroller.sol``` variable could be incorrect due to ```totalFrozen``` being subtracted from the ```totalStaked``` twice in the ```withdrawRewards``` function.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the ```withdrawRewards``` function of ```Comptroller.sol```, the ```_getUserManagerState``` function is called which will return totalStaked and totalFrozen values. The totalStaked returned by _getUserManagerState is calculated by subtracting the userManager.totalFrozen from the userManager.totalStaked and the totalFrozen returned is the userManager.totalFrozen. The ```withdrawRewards``` function will then calculate a new totalStaked value by subtracting userManagerState.totalFrozen from the userManagerState.totalStaked and use this new value in the ```_getInflationIndexNew``` function to get a new value for ```gInflationIndex```.

## Impact

The ```gInflationIndex``` variable could be updated incorrectly which could lead to incorrect reward calculations.

## Code Snippet

[Comptroller.sol:_getUserManagerState#L306-L316](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/token/Comptroller.sol#L306-L316):
```solidity
    function _getUserManagerState(IUserManager userManager) internal view returns (UserManagerState memory) {
        UserManagerState memory userManagerState;

        userManagerState.totalFrozen = userManager.totalFrozen();
        userManagerState.totalStaked = userManager.totalStaked() - userManagerState.totalFrozen;
        if (userManagerState.totalStaked < 1e18) {
            userManagerState.totalStaked = 1e18;
        }

        return userManagerState;
    }
```

The ```getUserManagerState``` function gets the userManager's totalFrozen and calculates the totalStaked as the userManager's totalStaked - its totalFrozen.

[Comptroller.sol:withdrawRewards#L260-L264](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/token/Comptroller.sol#L260-L264):
```solidity
        uint256 totalStaked_ = userManagerState.totalStaked - userManagerState.totalFrozen;
        gInflationIndex = _getInflationIndexNew(totalStaked_, block.number - gLastUpdatedBlock);
        gLastUpdatedBlock = block.number;
        users[account][token].updatedBlock = block.number;
        users[account][token].inflationIndex = gInflationIndex;
```

In the ```withdrawRewards``` function, the totalStaked used to claculate the new inflationIndex is calculated as the userManagerState's totalStaked - totalFrozen again.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

In the ```withdrawRewards``` function, do not subtract totalFrozen from the totalStaked again.
