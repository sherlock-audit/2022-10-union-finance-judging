# `effectiveCount` requirement can be bypassed

## Summary
When registering, users can bypass the requirement of having more than `effectiveCount` real vouches.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `UserManager`, [`updateTrust`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/user/UserManager.sol#L525) can be called with a `trustAmount` of 0. The vouch would still be added to `vouchers[borrower]`, although `trustAmount == 0`. 

Then in `registerMember`, a new member could be registered despite all its current `vouch` being zero.

## Impact
This could lead to:
- the system not working as designed
- new members joining despite no one trusting them, infiltrating the Union to then open credit lines

## Code Snippet
The vulnerability lies either in the `updateTrust` function, either here:

```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < vouchersLength; i++) {
  Vouch memory vouch = vouchers[newMember][i];
  Staker memory staker = stakers[vouch.staker];
  if (staker.stakedAmount > 0) count++;
  if (count >= effectiveCount) break;
}
```

## Recommendation
Check in `updateTrust` that `trustAmount != 0`
