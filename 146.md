# Vouchers that vouches first may not get their stake locked or unlocked sequentially according to updateLocked() if cancelVouch() is called

## Summary

Line 792, UserManager.sol
```
     *  @dev    Locks/Unlocks the borrowers stakers staked amounts in a first in
     *          First out order. Meaning the members that vouched for this borrower
     *          first will be the first members to get their stake locked or unlocked
     *          following a borrow or repayment.
```

When cancelVouch() is called, the ordering of vouchers for a borrower becomes messed up.

## Vulnerability Detail

1. There are 5 vouchers for a borrower
2. Borrower decides to remove the first voucher by calling cancelVouch()
3. Voucher 1 index is replaced by voucher 5 and voucher 5's index is popped off.
4. Now, voucher 5 is the first in line to receive rewards.

## Impact

It will be unfair for early vouchers as they will not get their stake locked or unlock first.
