# Tweaking supported token will dos withdrawal

## Summary
If a supported token is removed using removeToken function, then user wont be able to withdraw funds and funds will get stuck in money market

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Assume token T1 is a supported token
2. Stake is made via User Manager which is finally deposited in Asset Manager
3. Since token is supported so lets say this deposit goes to money market M1
4. Now Admin decides to remove this token support using removeToken function
5. Unstake is made via User Manager which calls withdraw at Asset Manager
6. Since token is not supported, withdraw will not try to loop into money market which is actually holding the funds

```python
if (isMarketSupported(token)) {
            uint256 withdrawSeqLength = withdrawSeq.length;
            // iterate markets according to defined sequence and withdraw
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < withdrawSeqLength && remaining > 0; i++) {
...
```

7. Due to this withdraw will fail due to lack of funds

## Note
Same issue lies with removeAdapter since if deposit is made to money market which is later removed then no withdraw

## Impact
Withdraw/Unstake will fail
