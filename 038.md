# People won't be able to borrow the exact amount vouched to them, because of the borrow fee.

## Summary
People won't be able to borrow the exact amount vouched to them, because of the borrow fee.

## Vulnerability Detail
Kiki stakes 10 000 Dai and vouches the amount of 5 000 Dai to Jake.
Jake calls the function `borrow()` to borrow the 5 000 tokens.
The function calls `updateLocked()` in the UserManager providing:
`updateLocked(msg.sender, uint96(amount + fee), true)`

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/market/UToken.sol#L552

Let's say for the example that the calculated fee is 50 Dai for the borrow of 5 000 tokens.
This will be the outcome of the function `updateLocked`:

`remaining = 5 050`

`stakerLocked = stakers[vouch.staker].locked` => `stakerLocked = 0`
`stakerStakedAmount = stakers[vouch.staker].stakedAmount` => `stakerStakedAmount => 10 000`
`availableStake = stakerStakedAmount - stakerLocked` => `availableStake = 10 000 - 0` => `availableStake = 10 000`
`lockAmount = _min(availableStake, vouch.trust - vouch.locked)` => `_min(10 000, 5 000)` => `lockAmount = 5 000`
`innerAmount = _min(remaining, lockAmount)` => `_min(5 050, 5 000)` => `innerAmount = 5 000`
`stakers[vouch.staker].locked = stakerLocked + innerAmount` => `stakers[vouch.staker].locked = 5 000`
`vouch.locked += innerAmount` => `0 += 5000` => `vouch.locked = 5 000`

`remaining -= innerAmount` => `5 050 -= 5 000` => `50`

// Since the remaining is 50, `updateLocked` will revert leading to the borrow function reverting as well.
`if (remaining > 0) revert LockedRemaining()`

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/user/UserManager.sol#L800-L853

As how it is now, the function `updateLocked` will revert, if a person wants to borrow the exact amount vouched to him.

The example in the union's docs is wrong: 
`Many â†’ 1: Groups working together: 3 people vouching $100 for a 4th, gives the 4th access to $300.`
The 4th person won't have access to 300$, it will be less because of the borrow fee.

Even if Jake needs the exact amount of 5 000 Dai vouched to him, he won't be able to get it because of the borrow fee.

## Impact
Duo to the issue described in `Vulnerability Detail`, people won't actually have access to the full amount vouched to them, because of the borrow fee.
