# AssetManager.sol#L374 : debtWriteOff should happen only if token is not Utoken.

## Summary
AssetManager.sol#L374 : `debtWriteOff` is happening without checking the whether the token is Utoken or not.

## Vulnerability Detail
Whenever the balances and totalPrincipal are updated, the check is done to verify the token is from Utoken or not.
this can be seen by following line of codes.

but, during debt write off this check is not considered.

## Impact
The token could be from utoken address.

If user send utoken address unknowingly to call write off the debt, but that operation could not happened.

But user, could have assumed that the debt write off had been done.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add validation check to verify wether the token is Utoken or not. Allow debtw write of only if the token is not from uToken.

    function debtWriteOff(address token, uint256 amount) external override {
        if (balances[msg.sender][token] < amount) revert InsufficientBalance();
        if (!_isUToken(msg.sender, token)){
        balances[msg.sender][token] -= amount;
        totalPrincipal[token] -= amount;
         }
    }
