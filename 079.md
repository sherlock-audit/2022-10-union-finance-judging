# AaveV3Adapter.sol withdraw function call return amount is not properly handled, which affecting unstaking and rebalance operation

## Summary

The AaveV3

AaveV3Adapter.sol withdraw function call return amount is not properly handled, which affecting unstaking operation.

Users may over-withdraw or not actually withdraw enough amount. Or the withdraw just revert and revert the unstaking operation. 

## Vulnerability Detail

Let me take a top-down approach and trace the function call:

The journey starts from UserManager.sol#unstake

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/user/UserManager.sol#L700-L706

the logic tries to withdraw the amount of token from AssetManager

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/user/UserManager.sol#L703

Then Asset Manager loops through the moneyMarket to withdraw token and send back to user.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/asset/AssetManager.sol#L345-L360

this line is important.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/asset/AssetManager.sol#L357

if the AaveV3Adapter.sol is used, the function withdraw is called.

```solidity
function withdraw(
    address tokenAddress,
    address recipient,
    uint256 tokenAmount
) external override onlyAssetManager checkTokenSupported(tokenAddress) {
    lendingPool.withdraw(tokenAddress, tokenAmount, recipient);
}
```

ok this is important. this call does not have the returned amount properly.

```solidity
lendingPool.withdraw(tokenAddress, tokenAmount, recipient);
```

the lendingPool interface for withdraw function is

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/interfaces/aave/LendingPool3.sol#L70-L75

Yes it returns (uint256), which is not handled in the AaveV3Adapter.sol

We need to dig deeper and refers to Aave's lending pool implementation.

https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/f3e037b3638e3b7c98f0c09c56c5efde54f7c5d2/contracts/protocol/pool/Pool.sol#L197

```solidity
  function withdraw(
    address asset,
    uint256 amount,
    address to
  ) public virtual override returns (uint256) {
    return
      SupplyLogic.executeWithdraw(
        _reserves,
        _reservesList,
        _eModeCategories,
        _usersConfig[msg.sender],
        DataTypes.ExecuteWithdrawParams({
          asset: asset,
          amount: amount,
          to: to,
          reservesCount: _reservesCount,
          oracle: ADDRESSES_PROVIDER.getPriceOracle(),
          userEModeCategory: _usersEModeCategory[msg.sender]
        })
      );
  }
```

which calls 

https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/f3e037b3638e3b7c98f0c09c56c5efde54f7c5d2/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/SupplyLogic.sol#L105

```solidity
 * @return The actual amount withdrawn
 */
function executeWithdraw(
  mapping(address => DataTypes.ReserveData) storage reservesData,
  mapping(uint256 => address) storage reservesList,
  mapping(uint8 => DataTypes.EModeCategory) storage eModeCategories,
  DataTypes.UserConfigurationMap storage userConfig,
  DataTypes.ExecuteWithdrawParams memory params
) external returns (uint256) {
```

the function returned the actual withdrawal amount, so we should use this return value as the source of truth and use the before and after checks to make sure we withdraw the desired amount of tokens.

The return value for withdrawAll function is also not handled.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/asset/AssetManager.sol#L511-L519

which calls.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/asset/AaveV3Adapter.sol#L232

withdraw type(uint256.max) means withdraw all user balance.

https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/f3e037b3638e3b7c98f0c09c56c5efde54f7c5d2/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/SupplyLogic.sol#L116-L125

```solidity
    uint256 userBalance = IAToken(reserveCache.aTokenAddress).scaledBalanceOf(msg.sender).rayMul(
      reserveCache.nextLiquidityIndex
    );

    uint256 amountToWithdraw = params.amount;

    if (params.amount == type(uint256).max) {
      amountToWithdraw = userBalance;
    }
```

the function did not handle the return value from withdrawAll, the withdrawAll amount we get may be different from what we get.

## Impact

The code make the assumption we can withdraw the exact amount we passed in precisely.

```solidity
 uint256 withdrawAmount = supply < remaining ? supply : remaining; 
 remaining -= withdrawAmount; 
 moneyMarket.withdraw(token, account, withdrawAmount); 
```

The user that unstakes may not get their desired amount of token back,  which breaks project accounting and user's trust if we do not have the return amount from Aave properly.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The project can change the AaveV3Adapter.sol of withdraw to handle the return value.

```solidity
    function withdraw(
        address tokenAddress,
        address recipient,
        uint256 tokenAmount
    ) external override onlyAssetManager checkTokenSupported(tokenAddress) {
           uint256 balanceBefore = IERC20Upgradeable(tokenAddress).balanceOf(recipient);
           uint256 withdrawalAmount =  lendingPool.withdraw(tokenAddress, tokenAmount, recipient);
           uint256 balanceAfter = IERC20Upgradeable(tokenAddress).balanceOf(recipient);
           if(withdrawalAmount < tokenAmount || balanceAfter - balanceBefore <  tokenAmount) {
                revert InSufficientWithdrawalError();
           }
    }
```

same return value handling should be add in withdrawAll function as well
