# User cannot unstake when paused

## Summary
When contract is paused by Admin then ideally only staking should be paused and user should still be able to withdraw their funds via unstake. But it seems the current check whenNotPaused will prevent user from withdrawing

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Observe the withdraw function at AssetManager.sol#L328

```python
function withdraw(
        address token,
        address account,
        uint256 amount
    ) external override whenNotPaused nonReentrant onlyAuth(token) returns (bool) {
```

2. As we can see this requires contract to be not paused and then only withdraw can happen which is incorrect

## Impact
User will not be able to unstake until admin decides to unpause the contract which if delayed then will cause delay for user withdrawal

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Remove the whenNotPaused modifier from withdraw and unstake function. It should only be present for staking
