# Should only allow debtWriteOff() of AssetManager to be called from UserManager or UToken only

## Summary
Should only allow debtWriteOff() of AssetManager to be called from UserManager or UToken only.

## Vulnerability Detail
The balance and total principle values of AssetManager can only be increased (See AssetManager.sol#L273-L274) by calling the deposit function. This deposit function can only be accessed by UserManager or UToken (See AssetManager.sol#L265 and AssetManager.sol#L122-L124). The external functions that call this deposit function are

1) The **stake** function of UserManager
2) The **mint**, **addReserver** and **repayBorrow** functions of UToken

Therefore, the balance and total principle values of AssetManager should be reduced ONLY from UserManager or UToken. Calling debtWriteOff() of AssetManager directly SHOULD not be allowed.

## Impact
If any address can access debtWriteOff() of AssetManager **DIRECTLY**, the accounting / variable figures like 
1) staker, totalStaked of UserManager
2) totalBorrows, accountBorrows, totalReserves, and totalRedeemable, totalsupply, balanceOf of UToken
3) Those variables which are updated after calling withdrawRewards() of Comptroller from stake() of UserManager

Will be **WRONG** and mismatched / not synced with the balance and total principle values of AssetManager and this could lead to undesired behavior.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add the onlyAuth modifier to debtWriteOff()

```solidity
function debtWriteOff(address token, uint256 amount) external override {
        if (balances[msg.sender][token] < amount) revert InsufficientBalance();
        balances[msg.sender][token] -= amount;
        totalPrincipal[token] -= amount;
}
```

should be changed to 

```solidity
function debtWriteOff(address token, uint256 amount) onlyAuth(token) external override {
        if (balances[msg.sender][token] < amount) revert InsufficientBalance();
        balances[msg.sender][token] -= amount;
        totalPrincipal[token] -= amount;
}
```
