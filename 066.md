# UserManager.cancelVouch not updating voucherIndexes / voucheeIndexes

## Summary
`UserManager.cancelVouch` changes indices of items within `vouchers[borrower]` & `vouchees[staker]` (because of the swap), but does not update the corresponding entry for `voucherIndexes[borrower][staker]` & `voucheeIndexes[borrower][staker]`.

## Vulnerability Detail
`cancelVouch` performs a swap within `vouchers[borrower]` and `vouchees[staker]` before removing the last item:
```solidity
vouchers[borrower][voucherIndex.idx] = vouchers[borrower][vouchers[borrower].length - 1];
...
vouchees[staker][voucheeIndex.idx] = vouchees[staker][vouchees[staker].length - 1];
```
This means that the voucher that was previously at `vouchers[borrower][vouchers[borrower].length - 1]` is now at `vouchers[borrower][voucherIndex.idx]` (and the same for the vouchee).
However, the corresponding entry in `voucherIndexes` and `voucheeIndexes` is not updated. The function only deletes `voucherIndexes[borrower][staker]` and `voucheeIndexes[borrower][staker]` (because those entries were deleted).
But for both entries that were swapped, there is an entry `voucherIndexes[borrower][some_address]` and `voucheeIndexes[some_other_address][staker]` that now still point to their old position (which no longer exists).

## Impact
This wrong logic will lead to wrong behavior wherever `voucherIndexes` (and `voucheeIndexes`) is used. We can distinguish two cases:
1.) Directly after the removal: `voucherIndexes` refers now to an index that no longer exists. Therefore, `debtWriteOff` for this staker / borrower combination will revert (meaning writing off debt is no longer possible), `updateTrust` will revert, `getLockedStake` & `getVouchingAmount` will return a wrong value.
2.) When a new vouch is added for a borrower: Now, the index exists again, but it refers to a completely different vouch. Therefore, all actions that access `voucherIndex` for this borrower / staker combination will act on the wrong vouch (for instance `debtWriteOff`).

After some time, it can happen that most entries in `voucherIndexes` refer to the wrong indices, which bricks the system completely.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
When doing the swap, you need to update the `voucherIndexes` / `voucheeIndexes` of the entry that corresponds to the last entry in the lists (which was swapped).
