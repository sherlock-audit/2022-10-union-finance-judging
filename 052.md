# The user cannot dredrevereserves () if it is collecting or collecting paid tokens

## Summary
The user cannot dredrevereserves () if it is collecting or collecting paid tokens
## Vulnerability Detail
When the user `addReserves()`, there is no problem if it is a fee-oriented token, since the user pays the fee-oriented, and the contract is subjected to an `actualAddAmount` of tokens.
However, if the user wants to `removeReserves()`, the user will not receive the `reduceAmount` amount of tokens because the sending process requires a fee and the contract does not have enough tokens to pay

```solidity
function removeReserves(address receiver, uint256 reduceAmount)
	external
	override
	whenNotPaused
	nonReentrant
	onlyAdmin
{
	if (!accrueInterest()) revert AccrueInterestFailed();
	totalReserves -= reduceAmount;
	if (!IAssetManager(assetManager).withdraw(underlying, receiver, reduceAmount)) revert WithdrawFailed();
	emit LogReservesReduced(receiver, reduceAmount, totalReserves);
}
```
