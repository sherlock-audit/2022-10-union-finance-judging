# `voucherIndexes` is incorrectly updated

## Summary
In `cancelVouch`, `voucherIndexes` is incorrectly update, messing up the whole accountability and ultimately leading to loss of funds for `stakers`

## Vulnerability Detail
[Here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/user/UserManager.sol#L589), `vouchers[borrower][vouchers[borrower].length - 1]` is moved but 
`voucherIndexes` is not updated. So the user that created `vouchers[borrower][vouchers[borrower].length - 1]` cannot modify this `voucher` anymore has `voucherIndexes` is incorrect.

## Impact
Affected users will not be able to close or update their `trust` amounts anymore, hence will lose funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add the following line:

`voucherIndexes[borrower][vouchers[borrower][vouchers[borrower].length - 1].staker].idx = voucherIndex.idx`
