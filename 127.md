# UserManager.sol#debtWriteOff may be not publicly callable after the loan is overdue by overdue blocks + maxOverdueBlocks

## Summary

debtWriteOff may be not publicly callable after the loan is overdue byoverdue blocks + maxOverdueBlocks

## Vulnerability Detail

debtWriteOff is supposed to be publicly callable after the loan is overdue byoverdue blocks + maxOverdueBlocks

```solidity
// This function is only callable by the public if the loan is overdue by
// overdue blocks + maxOverdueBlocks. This stops the system being left with
// debt that is overdue indefinitely and no ability to do anything about it.
if (block.number <= lastRepay + overdueBlocks + maxOverdueBlocks) {
    if (staker != msg.sender) revert AuthFailed();
}
```

however, this is not the case because we can calling inside the function debtWriteOff.

```solidity
  if (vouch.trust == 0) {
      cancelVouch(staker, borrower);
  }
```

Who can call cancelVouch? Only staker or borrowers.

```solidity
function cancelVouch(address staker, address borrower) public onlyMember(msg.sender) whenNotPaused {
    if (staker != msg.sender && borrower != msg.sender) revert AuthFailed();
```

This means that even after the overdue period, only borrower or staker can call write debt off.

Borrower may  call this function to rug staker and violate their trust, but the borrower has no incentive to spend gas.

The staker may not have an incentive to call the function either, because this means they are paying the debt for the borrower

## Impact

debtWriteOff may be not publicly callable after the loan is overdue by overdue blocks + maxOverdueBlocks, result in project insolvency.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

I think when the cancelVouch is called inside the function debtWriteOff, the check below should be removed to make sure the debtWriteOff is publicly callable when the debt is overdue.

```solidity
 if (staker != msg.sender && borrower != msg.sender) revert AuthFailed();
```
