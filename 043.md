# User funds will stuck

## Summary
If Admin changes the existing userManagers address for a token then all existing deposit in old User Manager address for this token will get stuck

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Admin has kept userManager as U for token T using [setUserManager function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/market/MarketRegistry.sol#L89)

```python
function setUserManager(address token, address userManager) external onlyAdmin {
        userManagers[token] = userManager;
        emit LogAddUserManager(token, userManager);
    }
```
2. User A stakes amount 10 using [stake function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/user/UserManager.sol#L664)

```python
function stake(uint96 amount) public whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
...
if (!IAssetManager(assetManager).deposit(stakingToken, amount)) revert AssetManagerDepositFailed();
...
```

3. So user staked funds are deposited in Asset Manager

4. Now Admin changes the User Manager address using setUserManager for the same token T

5.  User A wishes to unstake 

```python
function unstake(uint96 amount) external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
...
if (!IAssetManager(assetManager).withdraw(stakingToken, msg.sender, amount)) {
            revert AssetManagerWithdrawFailed();
        }
...
}
```

6. This calls AssetManager to withdraw which calls onlyAuth modifier

```python
modifier onlyAuth(address token) {
        if (!(_isUToken(msg.sender, token) || _isUserManager(msg.sender, token))) revert AuthFailed();
        _;
    }

function _isUserManager(address sender, address token) private view returns (bool) {
        return IMarketRegistry(marketRegistry).userManagers(token) == sender;
    }
```

7. Since User Manager is updated in step 4 so the Auth check fails and hence withdraw fails

## Impact
User funds will stuck

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
If not required then do not let Market Registry to change User manager for a token
If required then first make sure that all balances deposited in Asset Manager for this token is withdrawn
