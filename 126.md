# Removed adapter can still hold funds, removed token can still be deposited to a market

## Summary
Removed adapter can still hold funds, removed token can still be deposited to a market.
## Vulnerability Detail
When removing an adapter, there's no check for whether it's still holding funds ([AssetManager.sol#L440](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/asset/AssetManager.sol#L440)). The same is true for tokens: when removing a token, there's no check for whether any of the supported adapters is still holding assets in this token.
## Impact
In case an adapter that's being removed still holds funds, these funds will be removed from the total TVL until the removed adapter is re-added. And if there's no plans to re-add the adapter, the remaining funds will be locked in the adapter indefinitely.
Similarly to tokens: if any of the supported markets is still holding a token that's being removed, the token assets held by the market will be removed from the total TVL and users won't be able to get their funds.
## Code Snippet
[AssetManager.sol#L440](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/asset/AssetManager.sol#L440):
```solidity
function removeAdapter(address adapterAddress) external override onlyAdmin {
    bool isExist = false;
    uint256 index;
    uint256 moneyMarketsLength = moneyMarkets.length;

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < moneyMarketsLength; i++) {
        if (adapterAddress == address(moneyMarkets[i])) {
            isExist = true;
            index = i;
            break;
        }
    }

    if (isExist) {
        moneyMarkets[index] = moneyMarkets[moneyMarketsLength - 1];
        moneyMarkets.pop();
    }
}
```
[AssetManager.sol#L396](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/asset/AssetManager.sol#L396):
```solidity
function removeToken(address tokenAddress) external override onlyAdmin {
    bool isExist = false;
    uint256 index;
    uint256 supportedTokensLength = supportedTokensList.length;

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < supportedTokensLength; i++) {
        if (tokenAddress == address(supportedTokensList[i])) {
            isExist = true;
            index = i;
            break;
        }
    }

    if (isExist) {
        supportedTokensList[index] = supportedTokensList[supportedTokensLength - 1];
        supportedTokensList.pop();
        supportedMarkets[tokenAddress] = false;
    }
}
```
## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
In the `removeAdapter` function, check market's supply by calling `moneyMarket.getSupply(token)` before removing an adapter. In the `removeToken` function, iterate over all supported adapters and check if they're still holding the token by calling `moneyMarket.getSupply(token)`.
