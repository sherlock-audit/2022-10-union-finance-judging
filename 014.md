# Debt Cannot Be Written Off

## Summary

The User Manager allows debt to be written off by a staker after a block height threshold has been met. The implementation incorrectly checks this threshold.

## Vulnerability Detail

`UserManager.debtWriteOff`

On [line 78](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/user/UserManager.sol#L738) a check is performed to ensure the function is only able to be called at or after the `lastRepay + overdue blocks + maxOverdueBlocks` threshold. The `lastRepay` variable is set at the point of loan origination or updated at repayment. 

This requires the block height at the time the function is called to be greater than or equal to the `lastRepay + overdue blocks + maxOverdueBlocks` value. This condition is currently set to less than or equal.

## Impact

Debt after the `lastRepay + overdue blocks + maxOverdueBlocks`  threshold that has been exceeded will not be able to be written off.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
if (block.number <= lastRepay + overdueBlocks + maxOverdueBlocks) {
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Change this condition to be greater instead of less than:

```solidity
if (block.number >= lastRepay + overdueBlocks + maxOverdueBlocks) {
```
