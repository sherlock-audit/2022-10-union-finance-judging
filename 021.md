# Incorrect Repayment Calculation

## Summary

Borrowers will use the Union Lens contract via a UI which presents the repayment due. The amount they owe is being calculated and presented incorrectly.

## Vulnerability Detail

[`UToken.borrow`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/market/UToken.sol#L536-L540)

Borrowers should borrow principal and pay fees. The total amount due for repayment is being calculated as the principal + origination fee + interest of (principal + origination fee).

If the borrower defaults the platform doesn't earn the loan origination fee. Whereas if the fee is deducted at the point of origination then there's always a fee being earned. 

This also affects the borrower's [balance tracking](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/market/UToken.sol#L536-L540). This data structure is presented to the user via the Union Lens and will reflect more than the borrower is required to pay back.

## Impact

- Borrowers are being charged more than they should be.
- Borrowers will be presented with an incorrect higher figure to repay on the UI.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
accountBorrows[msg.sender].principal += amount + fee;
uint256 newPrincipal = getBorrowed(msg.sender);
accountBorrows[msg.sender].interest = accountBorrowsNew - newPrincipal;
accountBorrows[msg.sender].interestIndex = borrowIndex;
totalBorrows = totalBorrowsNew;
```

## Recommendation

- Charge interest for the the principal only
