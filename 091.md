# UDai.sol#L9-L23 : repayBorrowWithPermit will revert if argument-nonce does not match with DAI nonce

## Summary
UDai.sol#L9-L23 : repayBorrowWithPermit will revert if nonce provided as argument does not match with DAI's nonce

## Vulnerability Detail
Function `repayBorrowWithPermit` takes `nonce` as argument and calling the dai's permit function.

When we look at the DAI's permit function, it has check for nonce matching.

If both nonce are not matching, `repayBorrowWithPermit` function will revert.

## Impact
If the nonces are not matching, `repayBorrowWithPermit` function will revert.
I believe that this `nonce` input from the user and may be in front end.

It may not be always assure that the correct nonce are passed by user.

If it is handled by front end, fine, it would work till some technical glitches . If some issues happen at front end, it may be tough to guess the nonce value.
If the nonce value need to be know after its sequence is lost, worst case scenario could take order(n) searching. This is again loss of fund.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Instead of providing the nonce as input,  have a state variubale for nonce and increment for each calling. 
Kindly refer the DAI https://github.com/makerdao/dss/blob/fa4f6630afb0624d04a003e920b0d71a00331d98/src/dai.sol#L45
to check how the nonce are tracked for each calling.
