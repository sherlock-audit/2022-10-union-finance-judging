# Any borrower can call the function `debtWriteOff()` and write off his debt using staker's locked funds.

## Summary
A simple mistake leads to the staker losing his funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function `debtWriteOff()` is used to write off a borrowers debt, using the staker's locked stake to write off the loan.

The problem occurs with the wrongly applied if statement, the if statement triggers when the loan is overdue and checks if the `msg.sedner` is the staker.

However this statement won't be triggered, when the loan isn't overdue and the function won't check if the `msg.sender` calling the function is the staker. So a malicious borrower can call the function and write off his debt using staker's locked funds.

As how it is now any borrower can call the function `debtWriteOff()`, when his loan isn't overdue and successfuly write off his debt using staker's locked funds. 

## Impact
A malicious borrower will be able to write off his debt using staker's locked funds.
