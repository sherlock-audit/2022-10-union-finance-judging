# Depositers will get less minted shares and lose their funds.

## Summary
Duo to a wrong calculation of the minted amount of shares, every user who deposits after the first depositer will be able to only redeem a certain amount of funds from his deposited amount in the first place.

## Vulnerability Detail
Example:
The first depositer Jake calls the function `mint()` providing 10 000 Dai tokens:
 `totalRedeemable += actualMintAmount` => `totalRedeemable += 10 000` => `totalRedeemable = 10 000`.
`"exchangeRate" will be equal to "initialExchangeRateMantissa" for the first depositer when "tokenSupply = 0"`.
`mintTokens = (actualMintAmount * WAD) / exchangeRate` => `(10 000 * 1e18) / 1e18` => `mintTokens = 10 000`.
The function `mint()` will successfuly mint 10 000 uDai shares to Jake and after his deposit both `totalRedeemable` and `tokenSupply()` will be equal to 10 000.

// The issue described below will occur after the first depositer.
// The problem here is that `exchangeRateStored()` returns `tokenSupply()` which includes the sum of old deposits without the new one Kiki will do, since `totalRedeemable` is updated before the `mintTokens` calculation and the `tokenSupply()` is the old one. 
The calculation will be wrong and the function will mint less shares. 
As you can see below the function `exchangeRateStored()` calls the function `tokenSupply()`, which sums all the deposits made to AssetManager. But in the function `mint()` the deposit to AssetManager is made at the end of the function, so `mintTokens` calculation will be based on the previous deposits and the already updated `totalRedeemable`.

Kiki calls the function `mint()` and provides 10 000 Dai tokens as well. However this time instead of minting 10 000 uDai shares, the function will mint 5 000 shares and Kiki will lose his 5 000 Dai tokens. Duo to the fact that the function sums `actualMintAmount` to `totalRedeemable`, before it calculates the `mintTokens` and `exchangeRateStored()` returns the old `tokenSupply()`, 
less shares will be minted to Kiki. The outcome from the formula calculating Kiki's shares will look like this:
`exchangeRate = (totalRedeemable * WAD) / totalSupply_` => `(20 000 * 1e18) / 10 000` => `exchangeRate = 2 billion`
`mintTokens = (actualMintAmount * WAD) / exchangeRate` => `(10 000 * 1e18) / 2 billion` => `mintTokens = 5 000`
The function will mint 5000 uDai shares from Kiki's deposited amount of 10 000 Dai tokens.

Later when Kiki calls the function `redeem()` to withdraw his tokens, he will be able to get back only 5 000 Dai tokens.
Since Kiki has only 5 000 shares, `amountIn` will be equal to 5 000 and his tokens will be calculated based on this:
`exchangeRate = (totalRedeemable * WAD) / totalSupply_` => `(20 000 * 1e18) / 20 000` => `exchangeRate = 1 billion`
`underlyingAmount = (amountIn * exchangeRate) / WAD` => `(5 000 * 1e18) / 1 billion` => `underlyingAmount => 5 000`
The function `redeem()` will return only 5 000 Dai tokens to Kiki instead of the 10 000 Dai he deposited.

Following this scenario every user who deposits after the first depositer will lose a certain amount of his funds.

## Impact
With the issue described in "Vulnerability Detail", every user who deposits after the first depositer will lose a certain amount from his deposited funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The problem here is that in the `mint()` function `mintTokens` are calculated based on the already updated amount of `totalRedeemable` and the old `tokenSupply()`.

To fix this problem consider summing `actualMintAmount` to `exchangeRateStored()` in the cache exchangeRate:

However the fix will affect the first depositer, when the `tokenSupply()` equals zero and `exchangeRateStored()` returns `initialExchangeRateMantissa`. Consider adding 1 Dai token with the function `mint()`, which will always stay in AssetManager and then applying the recommended change.
