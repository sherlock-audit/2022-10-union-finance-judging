# UNION rewards issuance can be maximized without providing credit

## Summary

UNION rewards accounting is run on user direct request and stake/unstake only, and due to this can be gamed to obtain maximal rewards without any involvement in UNION, and in a risk-free way.

## Vulnerability Detail

Reward calculation currently is being invoked only as a part of user-facing stake(), unstake() and withdrawRewards(). Notice that withdrawRewards() calculates the rewards for `msg.sender`, so it cannot be triggered automatically by a script for all active users to refresh their accounting. This way UNION rewards are calculated only per user request and there are no updates on key account state changing operations.

This combination allows a malicious user to receive rewards with maximal `2x` multiplier without participating in UNION, particularly without bearing any credit risk or interest expenses. 

Say Bob the staker wants to maximize UNION rewards and minimize the corresponding risk. Bob stakes and do nothing else for a prolonged period, say 2 years. Then he becomes a member, loans to himself the full stake via another account and immediately calls withdrawRewards(), obtaining rewards for the whole 2 year period, his full stake, with the maximal multiplier, i.e. with `_getRewardsMultiplier` of `2`.

## Impact

Bloated UNION rewards emissions attacker initiates dilute holdings of the honest members who do not time their withdrawRewards() calls to the points of reward multiplier maximization.

This is monetary loss for all UNION holders (as total emission is increased), and particularly for the stakers who actually use the system (as specifically new emission is increased), i.e. in result the attacker steals from all holders/stakers by inflating UNION emission.

Setting severity to be high as there are no specific preconditions for the attack, it can be carried out by any UNION staker.

## Code Snippet 

The only function that updates the rewards due to a particular user is Comptroller's _calculateRewardsByBlocks().

_calculateRewardsByBlocks() calculates the rewards based on the current state of a user:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/token/Comptroller.sol#L396-L429

```solidity
    function _calculateRewardsByBlocks(
        address account,
        address token,
        uint256 pastBlocks,
        Info memory userInfo,
        UserManagerState memory userManagerState,
        UserManagerAccountState memory userManagerAccountState
    ) internal view returns (uint256) {
        IUserManager userManagerContract = _getUserManager(token);

        // Lookup account state from UserManager
        userManagerAccountState.totalStaked = userManagerContract.getStakerBalance(account);
        userManagerAccountState.totalLocked = userManagerContract.getTotalLockedStake(account);
        userManagerAccountState.isMember = userManagerContract.checkIsMember(account);

        uint256 inflationIndex = _getRewardsMultiplier(
            userManagerAccountState.totalStaked,
            userManagerAccountState.totalLocked,
            userManagerAccountState.totalFrozen,
            userManagerAccountState.isMember
        );

        return
            userInfo.accrued +
            _calculateRewards(
                account,
                token,
                userManagerState.totalStaked,
                userManagerAccountState.totalStaked,
                userManagerAccountState.pastBlocksFrozenCoinAge,
                pastBlocks,
                inflationIndex
            );
    }
```

Specifically, `inflationIndex` is based solely on the current state of user's account:

```solidity
inflationIndex = _getRewardsMultiplier(
            userManagerAccountState.totalStaked,
            userManagerAccountState.totalLocked,
            userManagerAccountState.totalFrozen,
            userManagerAccountState.isMember
        )
```

_calculateRewards() multiplies the whole `(curInflationIndex - startInflationIndex).wadMul(effectiveStakeAmount)` by the `inflationIndex`:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/token/Comptroller.sol#L443-L466

```solidity
    function _calculateRewards(
        address account,
        address token,
        uint256 totalStaked,
        uint256 userStaked,
        uint256 frozenCoinAge,
        uint256 pastBlocks,
        uint256 inflationIndex
    ) internal view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 startInflationIndex = users[account][token].inflationIndex;
        if (userStaked * pastBlocks < frozenCoinAge) revert FrozenCoinAge();

        if (userStaked == 0 || totalStaked == 0 || startInflationIndex == 0 || pastBlocks == 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        uint256 effectiveStakeAmount = (userStaked * pastBlocks - frozenCoinAge) / pastBlocks;

        uint256 curInflationIndex = _getInflationIndexNew(totalStaked, pastBlocks);

        if (curInflationIndex < startInflationIndex) revert InflationIndexTooSmall();

        return (curInflationIndex - startInflationIndex).wadMul(effectiveStakeAmount).wadMul(inflationIndex);
    }
```

`inflationIndex = _getRewardsMultiplier(...)` is based on the current state of a user:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/token/Comptroller.sol#L523-L543

```solidity
    function _getRewardsMultiplier(
        uint256 userStaked,
        uint256 lockedStake,
        uint256 totalFrozen_,
        bool isMember_
    ) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        if (isMember_) {
            if (userStaked == 0 || totalFrozen_ >= lockedStake) {
                return memberRatio;
            }

            uint256 effectiveLockedAmount = lockedStake - totalFrozen_;
            uint256 effectiveStakeAmount = userStaked - totalFrozen_;

            uint256 lendingRatio = effectiveLockedAmount.wadDiv(effectiveStakeAmount);

            return lendingRatio + memberRatio;
        } else {
            return nonMemberRatio;
        }
    }
```

_calculateRewardsByBlocks() is invoked in Comptroller only as a part of two call sequences:

calculateRewards() -> calculateRewardsByBlocks() -> _calculateRewardsByBlocks(),

withdrawRewards() -> _calculateRewardsByBlocks().

Comptroller's calculateRewards() and calculateRewardsByBlocks() are public views, not used elsewhere:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/token/Comptroller.sol#L175-L211

```solidity
    /**
     *  @dev Calculate unclaimed rewards based on blocks
     *  @param account User address
     *  @param token Staking token address
     *  @param futureBlocks Number of blocks in the future
     *  @return Unclaimed rewards
     */
    function calculateRewardsByBlocks(
        address account,
        address token,
        uint256 futureBlocks
    ) public view override returns (uint256) {
        IUserManager userManager = _getUserManager(token);

        // Lookup account stataddress accounte from UserManager
        (
            UserManagerAccountState memory userManagerAccountState,
            Info memory userInfo,
            uint256 pastBlocks
        ) = _getUserInfoView(userManager, account, token, futureBlocks);

        // Lookup global state from UserManager
        UserManagerState memory userManagerState = _getUserManagerState(userManager);

        return
            _calculateRewardsByBlocks(account, token, pastBlocks, userInfo, userManagerState, userManagerAccountState);
    }

    /**
     *  @dev Calculate currently unclaimed rewards
     *  @param account Account address
     *  @param token Staking token address
     *  @return Unclaimed rewards
     */
    function calculateRewards(address account, address token) external view override returns (uint256) {
        return calculateRewardsByBlocks(account, token, 0);
    }
```

This way the only rewards accounting update is Comptroller's withdrawRewards(), which is `onlyUserManager`, and is called via user facing UserManager's stake(), unstake() and withdrawRewards():

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/token/Comptroller.sol#L231-L257

```solidity
    function withdrawRewards(address account, address token)
        external
        override
        whenNotPaused
        onlyUserManager(token)
        returns (uint256)
    {
        IUserManager userManager = _getUserManager(token);

        // Lookup account state from UserManager
        (
            UserManagerAccountState memory userManagerAccountState,
            Info memory userInfo,
            uint256 pastBlocks
        ) = _getUserInfo(userManager, account, token, 0);

        // Lookup global state from UserManager
        UserManagerState memory userManagerState = _getUserManagerState(userManager);

        uint256 amount = _calculateRewardsByBlocks(
            account,
            token,
            pastBlocks,
            userInfo,
            userManagerState,
            userManagerAccountState
        );
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/user/UserManager.sol#L710-L715

```solidity
    /**
     *  @dev collect staker rewards from the comptroller
     */
    function withdrawRewards() external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
        comptroller.withdrawRewards(msg.sender, stakingToken);
    }
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/user/UserManager.sol#L664-L667

```solidity
    function stake(uint96 amount) public whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
        IERC20Upgradeable erc20Token = IERC20Upgradeable(stakingToken);

        comptroller.withdrawRewards(msg.sender, stakingToken);
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/user/UserManager.sol#L691-L698

```solidity
    function unstake(uint96 amount) external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
        Staker storage staker = stakers[msg.sender];

        // Stakers can only unstaked stake balance that is unlocked. Stake balance
        // becomes locked when it is used to underwrite a borrow.
        if (staker.stakedAmount - staker.locked < amount) revert InsufficientBalance();

        comptroller.withdrawRewards(msg.sender, stakingToken);
```

I.e. there are no others means to actualize the rewards, the users can update whenever they want and this can be the only update for them.

This allows to remove both credit risk and interest expenses. I.e. there is no dilemma either lend to self and pay the interest or lend to someone else and bear the credit risk: it's possible to do nothing, wait for any desired time, then lend to self for 1 block, neither paying any meaningful interest, nor bearing any credit risk, and reap the UNION rewards for the whole period with the maximal multiplier.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Member registration and trust utilization change, i.e. borrowings and repayments, should trigger reward accounting update to correctly reflect the timing of changes in the reward formula.

As the most direct mitigation consider adding the staker's reward update to `registerMember`, `updateLocked` and `debtWriteOff` functions that change the account state and the values of the corresponding reward formula components.

registerMember():

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/user/UserManager.sol#L633-L654

```solidity
    function registerMember(address newMember) public virtual whenNotPaused {
        if (stakers[newMember].isMember) revert NoExistingMember();

        uint256 count = 0;
        uint256 vouchersLength = vouchers[newMember].length;

        // Loop through all the vouchers to count how many active vouches there
        // are that are greater than 0. Vouch is the min of stake and trust
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < vouchersLength; i++) {
            Vouch memory vouch = vouchers[newMember][i];
            Staker memory staker = stakers[vouch.staker];
            if (staker.stakedAmount > 0) count++;
            if (count >= effectiveCount) break;
        }

        if (count < effectiveCount) revert NotEnoughStakers();
+	comptroller.withdrawRewards(newMember, stakingToken);

        stakers[newMember].isMember = true;
        IUnionToken(unionToken).burnFrom(msg.sender, newMemberFee);

        emit LogRegisterMember(msg.sender, newMember);
    }
```

updateLocked():

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/user/UserManager.sol#L800-L841

```solidity
    function updateLocked(
        address borrower,
        uint96 amount,
        bool lock
    ) external onlyMarket {
        uint96 remaining = amount;

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < vouchers[borrower].length; i++) {
            Vouch storage vouch = vouchers[borrower][i];
            uint96 innerAmount;

            if (lock) {
                // Look up the staker and determine how much unlock stake they
                // have available for the borrower to borrow. If there is 0
                // then continue to the next voucher in the array
                uint96 stakerLocked = stakers[vouch.staker].locked;
                uint96 stakerStakedAmount = stakers[vouch.staker].stakedAmount;
                uint96 availableStake = stakerStakedAmount - stakerLocked;
                uint96 lockAmount = _min(availableStake, vouch.trust - vouch.locked);
                if (lockAmount == 0) continue;

                // Calculate the amount to add to the lock then
                // add the extra amount to lock to the stakers locked amount
                // and also update the vouches locked amount and lastUpdated block
                innerAmount = _min(remaining, lockAmount);
+		comptroller.withdrawRewards(vouch.staker, stakingToken);                
                stakers[vouch.staker].locked = stakerLocked + innerAmount;
                vouch.locked += innerAmount;
                vouch.lastUpdated = uint64(block.number);
            } else {
                // Look up how much this vouch has locked. If it is 0 then
                // continue to the next voucher. Then calculate the amount to
                // unlock which is the min of the vouches lock and what is
                // remaining to unlock
                uint96 locked = vouch.locked;
                if (locked == 0) continue;
                innerAmount = _min(locked, remaining);

                // Update the stored locked values and last updated block
+		comptroller.withdrawRewards(vouch.staker, stakingToken);                
                stakers[vouch.staker].locked -= innerAmount;
                vouch.locked -= innerAmount;
                vouch.lastUpdated = uint64(block.number);
            }
```

debtWriteOff():

```solidity
    function debtWriteOff(

        uint256 overdueBlocks = uToken.overdueBlocks();
        uint256 lastRepay = uToken.getLastRepay(borrower);

        // This function is only callable by the public if the loan is overdue by
        // overdue blocks + maxOverdueBlocks. This stops the system being left with
        // debt that is overdue indefinitely and no ability to do anything about it.
        if (block.number <= lastRepay + overdueBlocks + maxOverdueBlocks) {
            if (staker != msg.sender) revert AuthFailed();
        }

        Index memory index = voucherIndexes[borrower][staker];
        if (!index.isSet) revert VoucherNotFound();
        Vouch storage vouch = vouchers[borrower][index.idx];

        if (amount > vouch.locked) revert ExceedsLocked();

        // update staker staked amount
        stakers[staker].stakedAmount -= amount;
