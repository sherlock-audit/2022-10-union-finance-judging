# `UToken::borrow` will forgive interest if the principal is zero (`debtWriteOff` will result in that condition)

## Summary

The function `UToken::borrow` will wipe the interest if the borrower's principal is zero. The `debtWriteOff` will only pay back the `principal`, not the `interest`. So if the debt was written off, the borrower can borrow more without paying the interest from the previous debt.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `UToken::borrow` will check `borrowedAmount` by calling `borrowBalanceStoredInternal`. It assumes that if `loan.principal` is zero, there is no borrowed amount. However, there might be cases, where the principal is zero but the interest is not. The borrower's interest will be overwritten based on the information of borrowed amount. It effectively forgives the previous interest the borrower had.

One possible case of this is when the `staker` calls `UserManager::debtWriteOff`; the `staker` will only pay back the principal, not the interest:

It is worth noting that if the `staker` calls the `UserManager::debtWriteOff`, there is no check on overdue. Normally, the `borrower` cannot borrow more if the debt is overdue, but since `staker` can call `debtWriteOff` without being overdue, it can happen that `staker` calls `UserManager::debtWriteOff` and then the `borrower` calls `UToken::borrow`, which will result in the interest forgiveness described above. Thus, an attacker can borrow without paying interest by being a `staker` themselves, `debtWriteOff` and `borrow` again.


## Impact

The interest of debt can be forgiven

## Recommendation

The `UToken::borrowBalanceStoredInternal` should return the interest of the loan even if the principal is zero
