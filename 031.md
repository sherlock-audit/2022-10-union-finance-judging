# `cancelVouch()` can break some parts of the protocol due to the way it changes the vouchers array.

## Summary
`cancelVouch()` does a swap with the last index of `vouchers[]` array, and pop off the last element. But it does not update the `voucherIndexes[][]` array which references the affected voucher.

## Vulnerability Detail

Say, Alice and Bob are 2 stakers and they vouch for borrower. So we have,
`vouchers[borrower][0]` = Alice
`vouchers[borrower][1]` = Bob
Alice calls `cancelVouch()`.
`voucher[borrower][1]` is deleted and `voucher[borrower][0]` = Bob
However, `voucherIndexes[borrower][Bob] = 1` remains unchanged.
Any function that relies on `voucherIndexes` will revert if it tries to query for `vouchers[borrower][1]` which no longer exist.

## Impact

In particular, Bob will not be able to `cancelVouch` on this borrower as it always revert.
Bob will also not be able to `debtWriteOff()` for borrower for the same reason.
View functions that rely on `vouchesIndexes` will also not be reliable.
They are used in `getRelatedInfo()`, `getLockedStake()`, `getVouchingAmount()`.
The same is true for `voucheeIndexes`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

In `cancelVouch()`, instead of swapping and then popping off the last element, set the value of the deleted voucher to 0 to represent deletion in the `vouchers[]` and `vouchees[]` array.
