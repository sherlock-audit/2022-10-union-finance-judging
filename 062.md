# Downcast in UToken.borrow allowing borrows that should not be allowed

## Summary
In `UToken.borrow` `amount + fee` is downcasted to a `uint96`, which truncates the upper bits and can allow borrows that should not be allowed.

## Vulnerability Detail
`UToken.borrow` performs the following call:
```solidity
IUserManager(userManager).updateLocked(msg.sender, uint96(amount + fee), true);
```
The problem is that `amount` (and `fee`) are both `uint256`. When `amount + fee > type(uint96).max`, the cast will not revert, but the upper bits will simply be truncated.

## Impact
`updateLocked` should revert when the account does not have enough vouchers to cover the borrow amount. However, let's say `amount + fee == 2**96` and therefore, `uint96(amount + fee) == 0`. `updateLocked` will never revert for 0, meaning that this borrow will succeed no matter how many vouchers an account has.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Do a safe cast (revert when the amount is larger than `type(uint96).max`).
