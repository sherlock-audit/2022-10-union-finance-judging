# The public can’t call `debtWriteOff()` in specific case

## Summary
The public users can’t invoke `debtWriteOff()` in case `vouch.trust == 0`

## Vulnerability Detail
On `UserManager.sol` ==> `debtWriteOff()`
```solidity
         // This function is only callable by the public if the loan is overdue by
        // overdue blocks + maxOverdueBlocks. This stops the system being left with
        // debt that is overdue indefinitely and no ability to do anything about it.
        if (block.number <= lastRepay + overdueBlocks + maxOverdueBlocks) {
            if (staker != msg.sender) revert AuthFailed();
        }
```
The `debtWriteOff()` should be callable by any body after this time `lastRepay + overdueBlocks + maxOverdueBlocks`

But in case Alice  invoke `debtWriteOff()`
So the  `msg.sender() == address(Alice)`
And `address(Alice) != staker && `address(Alice) != borrower` 

in case `vouch.trust == 0`
```solidity
        if (vouch.trust == 0) {
            cancelVouch(staker, borrower);
        }
```
It will invoke `cancelVouch()`
On `cancelVouch()` we have this check 
```solidity
if (staker != msg.sender && borrower != msg.sender) revert AuthFailed();
``` 
Will revert so `debtWriteOff()` will revert 

## Impact
If the loan is overdue by overdue blocks + maxOverdueBlocks, the public would not invoke `debtWriteOff()` successfully  

## Code Snippet
```solidity
       function debtWriteOff(
        address staker,
        address borrower,
        uint96 amount
    ) external {
        if (amount == 0) revert AmountZero();
        uint256 overdueBlocks = uToken.overdueBlocks();
        uint256 lastRepay = uToken.getLastRepay(borrower);

           if (block.number <= lastRepay + overdueBlocks + maxOverdueBlocks) {
            if (staker != msg.sender) revert AuthFailed();
        }

        Index memory index = voucherIndexes[borrower][staker];
        if (!index.isSet) revert VoucherNotFound();
        Vouch storage vouch = vouchers[borrower][index.idx];

        if (amount > vouch.locked) revert ExceedsLocked();

        stakers[staker].stakedAmount -= amount;
        stakers[staker].locked -= amount;
        totalStaked -= amount;

         vouch.trust -= amount;
        vouch.locked -= amount;

            uint256 stakerFrozen = memberFrozen[staker];
        if (amount > stakerFrozen) {
            memberFrozen[staker] = 0;
            totalFrozen -= stakerFrozen;
        } else {
            totalFrozen -= amount;
            memberFrozen[staker] -= amount;
        }

        if (vouch.trust == 0) {
            cancelVouch(staker, borrower);
        }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
On `cancelVouch()` check if the call come from `debtWriteOff()` skip the check 
Or create  `cancelVouch()` with internal access without any check for `msg.sender()`
