# User can manipulate the balance of the Token adapter to block user deposit.

## Summary

Users can manipulate the balance of the Token adapter to block user deposits.

## Vulnerability Detail

When the user stake, the fund is handled by the asset manager, then deposit into the token adapter to generate yield.

which calls.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/asset/AssetManager.sol#L283-L292

However, the user can DOS the token adapter to not let the token adapter receive the fund deposit. because of this line.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/asset/AssetManager.sol#L287

moneyMarket.floorMap(token) is set by admin. 

what is moneyMarket.getSupply(token)?

There are two types of Token adapter, the AaveV3Adapter.sol check the AToken balance.

```solidity
  function _getSupply(address tokenAddress) internal view returns (uint256) {
      address aTokenAddress = tokenToAToken[tokenAddress];
      IERC20Upgradeable aToken = IERC20Upgradeable(aTokenAddress);
      uint256 balance = aToken.balanceOf(address(this));
      if (balance <= 10) {
          return 0;
      }
      return balance;
  }
```

the PureTokenAdapter.sol just check the token balance.

```solidity
  function _getSupply(address tokenAddress) internal view returns (uint256) {
      IERC20Upgradeable token = IERC20Upgradeable(tokenAddress);
      return token.balanceOf(address(this));
  }
```

Here comes an issue, a user can inflate the aToken balance of the AaveV3Adatper by sending the AToken directly to the AaveV3Adapter.sol or he can deposit on behalf of he AaveV3Adapter.sol, then the aToken is minted to the adapter.

https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/f3e037b3638e3b7c98f0c09c56c5efde54f7c5d2/contracts/protocol/pool/Pool.sol#L755

```solidity
  function deposit(
    address asset,
    uint256 amount,
    address onBehalfOf,
    uint16 referralCode
  ) external virtual override {
```

Yes. Hacker is not profitable, but this receives in the project leak value because the user's fund is not getting the yield they are suppose the generating. 

When remaining is True in deposit, the token is sent to the AssetManager.sol

```solidity
if (remaining) {
    poolToken.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
}
```

then user unstake and withdraw, the fund inside the AssetManager.sol has priority over the fund in Adapter.sol, 

```solidity
// If there are tokens in Asset Manager then transfer them on priority
uint256 selfBalance = IERC20Upgradeable(token).balanceOf(address(this));
if (selfBalance > 0) {
    uint256 withdrawAmount = selfBalance < remaining ? selfBalance : remaining;
    remaining -= withdrawAmount;
    IERC20Upgradeable(token).safeTransfer(account, withdrawAmount);
}
```

this means that user deposit with no yield, and when withdraw they get their exact amount token back, which means the user has no incentive to stake.

## Impact

 user deposit with no yield, and when withdraw they get their exact amount token back, which means the user has no incentive to stake.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the project remove the check below

```solidity
if (moneyMarket.floorMap(token) <= moneyMarket.getSupply(token)) continue;
```

Or set a different floorMap for all market because it is likely that different market can absorb different capacity to generate yield.
