# There is no way to manage bad debt or any loss made by `Aave` for `stakers`

## Summary
Underlying lending protocols used by `AssetManager` may get hacked, bad debt or take a loss somehow. In this case, there is no management system within Union and it'd be a First In First Out to get the remaining funds. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Assume Aave or an underlying lending protocols used by `AssetManager` takes a loss. This seems likely as `AssetManager` seems build to support multiple lending platforms.

Then, `totalPrincipal[tokenAddress]` would be less than the total amount managed by `AssetManager`. So putting lenders aside, all stakers won't be able to withdraw their funds. As `totalPrincipal` and `balances` cannot be adjust to tackle this situation, and as the system is not automatically paused, the loss isn't distributed fairly, creating a bank run situation even for an overall small loss.

The system would keep on running like there is no bad debt and this will create a bank run situation, where the last stakers that don't withdraw their funds would be reckt.

## Impact
In case of issue with an underlying lending protocol, some stakers will loose funds, the loss wouldn't be fairly distributed, and it will create a bank run to exit Union. 

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In `withdraw`, check that that `getPoolBalance(tokenAddress) > totalPrincipal[tokenAddress]` to ensure that there is enough funds for stakers. If it is not the case, either pause the system and transfer the funds to the governance for a fair settlement, either distribute the loss fairly directly.
