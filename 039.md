# Unable To Borrow From DAI Market

## Summary

`UDai` extends `UToken` to add `permit` functionality to enable lower gas costs for users. Borrowers attempting to `borrow()` will not be able to do so as the User Manager has a modifier that only allows calls from a single contract source, the `UToken` address.

## Vulnerability Detail

[`UDai`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/market/UDai.sol#L8)

This contract deploys an instance of `UToken` with the additional `permit` functionality. If a user attempts to call `borrow` it will fail as this function calls the [User Manager](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/market/UToken.sol#L552) and there is a [modifier](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/user/UserManager.sol#L300) on this function that only allows calls from a single `UToken` address.

## Impact

- Borrowers will be unable to borrow from contract instances of `UDai`

## Code Snippet

```solidity
IUserManager(userManager).updateLocked(msg.sender, uint96(amount + fee), true);
```

```solidity
function updateLocked(
    address borrower,
    uint96 amount,
    bool lock
) external onlyMarket {
```

```solidity
modifier onlyMarket() {
    if (address(uToken) != msg.sender) revert AuthFailed();
    _;
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- Introduce a modifier to enable calls to `borrow()` from `uToken` and `uTokenDai` instances:

```solidity
modifier onlyUMarket() {
    if (address(uToken) != msg.sender) revert AuthFailed();
    _;
}

modifier onlyUMarketDai() {
    if (address(uTokenDai) != msg.sender) revert AuthFailed();
    _;
}
```
