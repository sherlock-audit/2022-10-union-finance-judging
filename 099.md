# Borrowers can borrow to update vouch.lastUpdated before the loan is overdue, thus avoiding the staked tokens from being frozen

## Summary
vouch.lastUpdated is updated every time the borrower borrows, allowing the borrower to avoid staked tokens from being frozen.

## Vulnerability Detail
UToken.borrow will call UserManager.updateLocked to update the locked token information.
However, UToken.borrow only updates accountBorrows.lastRepay when the debt goes from zero to non-zero, while UserManager.updateLocked updates vouch.lastUpdated on every borrow.
vouch.lastUpdated determines when staked tokens are frozen, which allows borrowers to update vouch.lastUpdated by borrowing before the loan is overdue, thus preventing staked tokens from being frozen.

## Impact
Borrowers can prevent staked tokens from being frozen

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider that in UserManager.updateLocked, when locked is true, vouch.lastUpdated is updated only when the debt goes from zero to non-zero.
```diff
                innerAmount = _min(remaining, lockAmount);
                stakers[vouch.staker].locked = stakerLocked + innerAmount;
+               if( vouch.locked = 0 )  vouch.lastUpdated = uint64(block.number);
                vouch.locked += innerAmount;
-               vouch.lastUpdated = uint64(block.number);
```
