# Depositers will get less minted shares and lose their funds.

## Summary
Duo to a wrong calculation of the minted amount of shares, every user who deposits after the first depositer will be able to only redeem a certain amount of funds from his deposited amount in the first place.

## Vulnerability Detail
Example:
The first depositer Jake calls the function `mint()` providing 10 000 Dai tokens:
 `totalRedeemable += actualMintAmount` => `totalRedeemable += 10 000` => `totalRedeemable = 10 000`.
`"exchangeRate" will be equal to "initialExchangeRateMantissa" for the first depositer when "tokenSupply = 0"`.
`mintTokens = (actualMintAmount * WAD) / exchangeRate` => `(10 000 * 1e18) / 1e18` => `mintTokens = 10 000`.
The function `mint()` will successfuly mint 10 000 uDai shares to Jake and after his deposit both `totalRedeemable` and `tokenSupply()` will be equal to 10 000.

// Every depositer after Jake will lose his funds.

Kiki calls the function `mint()` and provides 10 000 Dai tokens as well. However this time instead of minting 10 000 uDai shares, the function will mint 5 000 shares and Kiki will lose his 5 000 Dai tokens. Duo to the fact that the function sums `actualMintAmount` to `totalRedeemable`, before it calculates the `mintTokens` the outcome will be way different. 
Since the function `exchangeRateStored()` returns the amount of `totalSupply()` based on the amounts deposited to the pool. 
The outcome from the formula calculating Kiki's shares will look like this:
`exchangeRate = (totalRedeemable * WAD) / totalSupply_` => `(20 000 * 1e18) / 10 000` => `exchangeRate = 2 billion`
`mintTokens = (actualMintAmount * WAD) / exchangeRate` => `(10 000 * 1e18) / 2 billion` => `mintTokens = 5 000`
The function will mint 5000 uDai shares from Kiki's deposited amount of 10 000 Dai tokens.

Later when Kiki calls the function `redeem()` to withdraw his tokens, he will be able to get back only 5 000 Dai tokens.
Since Kiki has only 5 000 shares, `amountIn` will be equal to 5 000 and his tokens will be calculated based on this:
`exchangeRate = (totalRedeemable * WAD) / totalSupply_` => `(20 000 * 1e18) / 20 000` => `exchangeRate = 1 billion`
`underlyingAmount = (amountIn * exchangeRate) / WAD` => `(5 000 * 1e18) / 1 bill` => `underlyingAmount => 5 000`
The function `redeem()` will return only 5 000 Dai tokens to Kiki instead of the 10 000 Dai he deposited.

Following this scenario every user who deposits after the first depositer will lose a certain amount of his funds.

## Impact
With the issue described in "Vulnerability Detail", every user who deposits after the first depositer will lose a certain amount from his deposited funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The problem here is that the `totalRedeemable` amount is updated before the calculation of `mintTokens`. 
Since in the function `exchangeRateStored()` the "tokenSupply" equals to the tokens deposited from UToken to the AssetManager and this deposit happens at the end of the `mint()` function. 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/market/UToken.sol#L694

Example:
`totalRedeemable = 10 000` and `tokenSupply() = 10 000`
Kiki calls the function `mint()` with 10 000  Dai.
Duo to `totalRedeemable += actualMintAmount` => `10 000 += 10 000` => `totalRedeemable = 20 000`

The outcome of the formula for `exchangeRateStored()` will look like this:
`(totalRedeemable * WAD) / totalSupply_` => `(20 000 * 1e18) / 10 000`.
10 000 is the `tokenSupply()` which includes the amount of old deposits and not the new one of 10 000 tokens sent to the UToken contract.

To fix this problem consider summing `actualMintAmount` to `exchangeRateStored()` in the cache exchangeRate:

However the fix will affect the first depositer, when the `tokenSupply()` equals zero and `exchangeRateStored()` returns `initialExchangeRateMantissa`. Consider adding 1 Dai token with the function `mint()`, which will always stay in AssetManager and then applying the recommended change.
