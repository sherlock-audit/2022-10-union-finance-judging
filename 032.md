# Admin can rug as they are allowed to freely set important addresses with no warning to users.

## Summary
The protocol has a huge trust model of the admin account. It may not be the intentions of the admin, but we do want to reduce the possibility of rug pulls if possible considering the current landscape of crypto. Ideally, a protocol that does not require the trust of any admin accounts can give the users the most assurance.

## Vulnerability Detail
Functions that changes key addresses can allow malicious admin to set and make malicious calls with custom contracts.
We have, `setUToken()`, `setUserManager()`, `setMarketRegistry()`, `setAssetManager()`, all of which can be used to steal funds in some way when used in all or some combinations as all user funds are stored in `AssetManager` contract.

## Impact
A malicious/compromised admin account can steal all user funds with no way for users to respond to.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a timelock for the mentioned core contracts of the protocol when updating them. This allows users to choose to withdraw their funds in case of any malicious attacks.  Also note that `setMarketRegistry()` currently does not emit any event.
