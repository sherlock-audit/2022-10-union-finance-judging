# can not withdraw after `removeToken()`

## Summary

If there is still some balance in the underlying token and associated market, fund will be locked and no way to withdraw if the token is removed by admin.


## Vulnerability Detail

`supportedMarkets[tokenAddress]` will be false after `removeToken()`, `AssetManager.withdraw()` will skip the `if (isMarketSupported(token))` block, so the fund cannot be withdrawn.


## Impact

Lock users fund.

## Tool used

Manual Review


## Recommendation

Provide method for users to withdraw fund even if the token is not deactivated. Maybe maintain some deactivated list of markets.
