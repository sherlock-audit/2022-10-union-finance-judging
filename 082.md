# UToken.sol#L604 : _repayBorrowFresh should deduct the principal amount only while update the principal. Should not consider the interest.

## Summary
When repaying the borrowed mount, `repayBorrow` function is called. `repayBorrow` calls the `_repayBorrowFresh`. In `_repayBorrowFresh`, both principal and interest amount is updated.  Both `principal` and  `interest` amount are updated based on the repayment amount. i.e, `if (repayAmount >= interest)` or not

## Vulnerability Detail
`if (repayAmount >= interest)`, In line [UToken.sol#L604](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/market/UToken.sol#L604), The principal is updated as shown below
`accountBorrows[borrower].principal = borrowedAmount - repayAmount;`
But the `repayAmount` is mixture of both principal and interest paid by the borrower. It is clear that this is mixture of both principal and interest by this check `if (repayAmount >= interest) {` in line [UToken.sol#L588](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/market/UToken.sol#L588).

It is clear that the borrower's paid interest also is included to update the principal.


## Impact
This has following impacts,
1. If borrower's principal and interest are both same value, the borrower can pay only interest as principal. He/she will not pay the principal.
2. Accounting issue.
3. Loss of funds.
