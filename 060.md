# Unbounded loop in `AssetMansger.sol::rebalance()` Can Lead To DoS

## Summary


There are some unbounded loops that can lead to DoS.


## Vulnerability Detail
rebalance() will traverse two arrays, `moneyMarketsLength`, and `percentagesLength`. The `moneyMarketsLength` will be traversed `withdrawAll()`, and the `percentagesLength` will be `safeTransfer()`. This operation uses a lot of gas. And for the incoming ` percentages ` parameter length without any restrictions.

## Recommendation
Consider avoiding all the actions executed in a single transaction, especially when calls are executed as part of a loop.
