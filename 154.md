# Using `removeReserves`, `admin` can withdraw all `lenders` funds.

## Summary
Using `removeReserves`, `admin` can withdraw all `lenders` funds as there is no safeguard on what can be withdrawn.

## Vulnerability Detail
This is a vulnerability regarding admin privileges and the fact that here, all assets deposited using the `mint` function of `UToken` can be withdrawn by the `admin` at any time.

*Side note: why the `whenNotPaused` modifier in `removeReserves` ? It's `onlyAdmin` anyway*.

## Impact

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function removeReserves(address receiver, uint256 reduceAmount)
    external
    override
    whenNotPaused
    nonReentrant
    onlyAdmin
{
    if (!accrueInterest()) revert AccrueInterestFailed();

    totalReserves -= reduceAmount;

    if (!IAssetManager(assetManager).withdraw(underlying, receiver, reduceAmount)) revert WithdrawFailed();

    emit LogReservesReduced(receiver, reduceAmount, totalReserves);
}
```
