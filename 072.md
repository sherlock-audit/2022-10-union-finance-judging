# Users will receive less than they expect from the `borrow()`

## Summary
Alice will invoke `borrow()` with `amount == X` 
He will receive only `X - n`
But `updateLocked()` will update locked with `X` value 

## Vulnerability Detail
On `UToken.sol` ==> `borrow()`
```solidity
if (!assetManagerContract.withdraw(underlying, to, amount)) revert WithdrawFailed();
```
On `AssetManager.sol` ==> `withdraw()` in case `isMarketSupported(token)` is `true`
This loop will work
```solidity
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < withdrawSeqLength && remaining > 0; i++) {
                IMoneyMarketAdapter moneyMarket = moneyMarkets[withdrawSeq[i]];
                if (!moneyMarket.supportsToken(token)) continue;

                uint256 supply = moneyMarket.getSupply(token);
                if (supply == 0) continue;

                uint256 withdrawAmount = supply < remaining ? supply : remaining;
                remaining -= withdrawAmount;
                moneyMarket.withdraw(token, account, withdrawAmount);
            }
```
in case `i == withdrawSeqLength` and `remaining > 0` this loop will stop. And there is no way to complete sending the `remaining` balace 
The  `withdraw()` will return `True` even if the `remaining > 0`

Now go back to `UToken.sol` ==> `borrow()`

```solidity
        if (!assetManagerContract.withdraw(underlying, to, amount)) revert WithdrawFailed();

        IUserManager(userManager).updateLocked(msg.sender, uint96(amount + fee), true);
```
The first check will passed successfully 
And the second line will update the locked amount to `amount + fee` even if the user dosenâ€™t receive all the `amount`

## Impact
The user will receive less amount of the locked

## Code Snippet
```solidity
          if (isMarketSupported(token)) {
            uint256 withdrawSeqLength = withdrawSeq.length;
            // iterate markets according to defined sequence and withdraw
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < withdrawSeqLength && remaining > 0; i++) {
                IMoneyMarketAdapter moneyMarket = moneyMarkets[withdrawSeq[i]];
                if (!moneyMarket.supportsToken(token)) continue;

                uint256 supply = moneyMarket.getSupply(token);
                if (supply == 0) continue;

                uint256 withdrawAmount = supply < remaining ? supply : remaining;
                remaining -= withdrawAmount;
                moneyMarket.withdraw(token, account, withdrawAmount);
            }
        }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
You can check `remaining` on `withdraw()`
