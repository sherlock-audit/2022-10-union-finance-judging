# `UToken::_repayBorrowFresh` does not subtract the `interest` from `repayAmount`

## Summary

When repaying more than the interest, the `UToken::_repayBorrowFresh` does not correctly calculate the new principal after repaying.

As the result:
  - The user's principal will be less than what it should be.
  - the `accountBorrow[borrower].principal` will not add up to `totalBorrows`

## Vulnerability Detail

When the user calls `UToken::repayBorrow` to repay the debt, `UToken::_repayBorrowFresh` will be called. In the `UToken::_repayBorrowFresh`, the principal and interest of the borrower will be updated.

In the case the user is repaying more than the interest, all the interest will be paid, and the principal should be reduced by the left over (`repayAmount` - `interest`). However, in the line 604, the principal will be  reduced by `repayAmount`. Effectively, the `interest` is forgiven without being paid. Thus, as long as the user repays more than the interest, the user does not need to pay the interest.

The `totalBorrows` in the line 601 is, however, correctly updated (reduced by `repayAmount - interest`). Therefore, the `principal` of all borrowers will not sum up to `totalBorrows`.

## Impact

- The user's principal is reduced more than the user repaid.
- the `accountBorrow[borrower].principal` will not add up to `totalBorrows`

## Recommendation

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/market/UToken.sol#L604

The line 604 should be:

```solidity
            accountBorrows[borrower].principal = borrowedAmount - repayAmount + interest;
```
