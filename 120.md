# Interest accrued after borrow amount checks in `UToken`

## Summary
Interest accrued after borrow amount checks in `UToken`
## Vulnerability Detail
[UToken](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/market/UToken.sol#L20) is an interest accruing token: borrowed amount accrue interest over time. Thus, borrowed amount is made of two parts: the principal and the interest. Since the interest is accrued over time, total amount borrowed by a user also increases over time. Thus, it's critical to update accrued interest before making any calculations involving borrowed amounts.

However, in the [borrow](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/market/UToken.sol#L512) function, interest is accrued after the maximal borrow amount check:
```solidity
if (borrowBalanceView(msg.sender) + amount + fee > maxBorrow) revert AmountExceedMaxBorrow();
if (checkIsOverdue(msg.sender)) revert MemberIsOverdue();
if (amount > assetManagerContract.getLoanableAmount(underlying)) revert InsufficientFundsLeft();
if (!accrueInterest()) revert AccrueInterestFailed();
```
## Impact
Due to interest being accrued after the maximal borrow check, a borrower can borrow more than the maximal borrow amount.  This can happen when accrued interest + `borrowBalanceView(msg.sender)` + `amount` + `fee` is greater than `maxBorrow`, but since interest accruing happens after the check, it won't be counted in the check.

## Recommendation
In the `borrow` function, call `accrueInterest()` as early as possible, similarly to how it's done in [_repayBorrowFresh](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/market/UToken.sol#L578).
