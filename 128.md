# User's fund is locked if the admin pause the contract

## Summary

Admin paused feature block user from withdrawal their fund.

## Vulnerability Detail

User can stake or unstake via UserManager.sol

```solidity
    function stake(uint96 amount) public whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
```

and 

```solidity
    function unstake(uint96 amount) external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
```

however, when if the admin pauses the contract via controller.

```solidity
function pause() external onlyGuardian whenNotPaused {
    _paused = true;
    emit LogPaused(msg.sender);
}
```

 the fund is locked and the user is not able to able to get their fund back until the admin unpause the contract.

## Impact

If the admin pause the contract, the pause can block user from withdrawing their unstake and withdraw.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

A common practice is that if the contract is paused, user cannot deposit or stake, but still able to withdraw and unstake.

We recommend the project to kindly remove the WhenNotPaused modifier from the unstake function

```solidity
    function unstake(uint96 amount) external nonReentrant {
```
