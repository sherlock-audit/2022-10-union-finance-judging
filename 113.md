# AssetManager.sol#rebalance can revert if single moneyMarket.withdrawAll revert / AaveV3Adapter.sol#withdrawAll revert if withdrawAmount is 0, and revert rebalancing transaction.

## Summary

AssetManager.sol#rebalance can revert if single moneMarket.withdrawAll revert / AaveV3Adapter.sol#withdrawAll revert if withdrawAmount is 0, and revert rebalancing transaction.

## Vulnerability Detail

The AssetManager.sol has a rebalance function for admin to rebalance the fund across different money market.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/asset/AssetManager.sol#L511-L519

However, the function withdrawAll are called in all money market. If one money market withdrawAll function revert, the transaction revert and rebalance failed.

In the current implementation, only PureTokenAdapter.sol#withrawAll and AaveV3Adapter.sol#withdrawAll are used.

The PureTokenAdapter.sol#withrawAll implementation is

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/asset/PureTokenAdapter.sol#L169-L178

The code above is unlikely to fail, so let us focus on the AaveV3Adapter.sol

The AaveV3Adapter.sol#withdrawAll is

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/asset/AaveV3Adapter.sol#L226-L234

which calls the function in AaveV3, let us refers external code aave

https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/f3e037b3638e3b7c98f0c09c56c5efde54f7c5d2/contracts/protocol/pool/Pool.sol#L196-L218

```solidity
function withdraw(
  address asset,
  uint256 amount,
  address to
) public virtual override returns (uint256) {
  return
    SupplyLogic.executeWithdraw(
      _reserves,
      _reservesList,
      _eModeCategories,
      _usersConfig[msg.sender],
      DataTypes.ExecuteWithdrawParams({
        asset: asset,
        amount: amount,
        to: to,
        reservesCount: _reservesCount,
        oracle: ADDRESSES_PROVIDER.getPriceOracle(),
        userEModeCategory: _usersEModeCategory[msg.sender]
      })
    );
}
```

which calls.

https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/f3e037b3638e3b7c98f0c09c56c5efde54f7c5d2/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/SupplyLogic.sol#L105-L128

```solidity
  function executeWithdraw(
    mapping(address => DataTypes.ReserveData) storage reservesData,
    mapping(uint256 => address) storage reservesList,
    mapping(uint8 => DataTypes.EModeCategory) storage eModeCategories,
    DataTypes.UserConfigurationMap storage userConfig,
    DataTypes.ExecuteWithdrawParams memory params
  ) external returns (uint256) {
    DataTypes.ReserveData storage reserve = reservesData[params.asset];
    DataTypes.ReserveCache memory reserveCache = reserve.cache();

    reserve.updateState(reserveCache);

    uint256 userBalance = IAToken(reserveCache.aTokenAddress).scaledBalanceOf(msg.sender).rayMul(
      reserveCache.nextLiquidityIndex
    );

    uint256 amountToWithdraw = params.amount;

    if (params.amount == type(uint256).max) {
      amountToWithdraw = userBalance;
    }

    ValidationLogic.validateWithdraw(reserveCache, amountToWithdraw, userBalance);
```

Which calls.

https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/f3e037b3638e3b7c98f0c09c56c5efde54f7c5d2/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/ValidationLogic.sol#L87-LL98

```solidity
function validateWithdraw(
  DataTypes.ReserveCache memory reserveCache,
  uint256 amount,
  uint256 userBalance
) internal pure {
  require(amount != 0, Errors.INVALID_AMOUNT);
  require(amount <= userBalance, Errors.NOT_ENOUGH_AVAILABLE_USER_BALANCE);

  (bool isActive, , , , bool isPaused) = reserveCache.reserveConfiguration.getFlags();
  require(isActive, Errors.RESERVE_INACTIVE);
  require(!isPaused, Errors.RESERVE_PAUSED);
}
```

**Clearly, if the withdraw-all amount is 0, withdrawAll revert,  the rebalance transaction revert.**

**if the pool is not active,  withdrawAll revert,  the rebalance transaction revert..**

**if the pool is paused in extreme market condition, withdrawAll revert,  the rebalance transaction revert..**

**if the aave pool is not active,  withdrawAll revert,  the rebalance transaction revert..**

**if the lending pool has a high utilization rate, the withdrawAll revert, the rebalance transaction revert**

## Impact

The fund across different money market cannot be rebalanced.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

At least I think to make sure the withdrawAll function in AaveV3Adapter.sol does not revert on 0 withdrawal balance,

we should change from

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-union-finance/blob/main/union-v2-contracts/contracts/asset/AssetManager.sol#L513

to

```solidity
            if (!moneyMarket.supportsToken(tokenAddress)) continue;
            if(moneyMarket.getSupply(tokenAddress) > 0) { 
                 moneyMarket.withdrawAll(tokenAddress, address(this));
            }
```

Basically the same as this issue: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-mycelium-judging/blob/main/013-M/168-report.md
