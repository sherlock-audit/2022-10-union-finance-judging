# Batch Update Frozen Info Inoperable

## Summary

In the UserManager there is a function to batch update the frozen info, intended to be called by external scripts. This will not be possible to succeed due to a modifier that exists on the Comptroller's function.

## Vulnerability Detail

`UserManager.batchUpdateFrozenInfo`

When a script calls the batch updater there is an external call to `comptroller.updateTotalStaked`. This function has a modifier that only permits calling from the User Manager. The `token` argument passed from the User Manager is the `stakingToken` variable, which is the address of the ERC20 staking token.

The modifier `onlyUserManager` will not allow the call to this function as it is expecting the address of the User Manager.

## Impact

Calls to `UserManager.batchUpdateFrozenInfo` will never succeed.

## Code Snippet

User Manager

```solidity
comptroller.updateTotalStaked(stakingToken, totalStaked - totalFrozen);
```

Comptroller Modifier

```solidity
modifier onlyUserManager(address token) {
    if (msg.sender != address(_getUserManager(token))) revert SenderNotUserManager();
    _;
}
```

Comptroller

```solidity
function updateTotalStaked(address token, uint256 totalStaked)
    external
    override
    whenNotPaused
    onlyUserManager(token)
    returns (bool)
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Call the Comptroller with a function argument of the calling contract address:

```solidity
comptroller.updateTotalStaked(address(this), totalStaked - totalFrozen);
```
